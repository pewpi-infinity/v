    <summary>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) currently achieve the state-of-the-art sound synthesis quality for pitched musical instruments using a 2-channel spectrogram representation consisting of log magnitude and instantaneous frequency (the "IFSpectrogram"). Many other synthesis systems use representations derived from the magnitude spectra, and then depend on a backend component to invert the output magnitude spectrograms that generally result in audible artefacts associated with the inversion process. However, for signals that have closely-spaced frequency components such as non-pitched and other noisy sounds, training the GAN on the 2-channel IFSpectrogram representation offers no advantage over the magnitude spectra based representations. In this paper, we propose that training GANs on single-channel magnitude spectra, and using the Phase Gradient Heap Integration (PGHI) inversion algorithm is a better comprehensive approach for audio synthesis modeling of diverse signals that include pitched, non-pitched, and dynamically complex sounds. We show that this method produces higher-quality output for wideband and noisy sounds, such as pops and chirps, compared to using the IFSpectrogram. Furthermore, the sound quality for pitched sounds is comparable to using the IFSpectrogram, even while using a simpler representation with half the memory requirements.</summary>

    <summary>Humans have a privileged, embodied way to explore the world of sounds, through vocal imitation. The Quantum Vocal Theory of Sounds (QVTS) starts from the assumption that any sound can be expressed and described as the evolution of a superposition of vocal states, i.e., phonation, turbulence, and supraglottal myoelastic vibrations. The postulates of quantum mechanics, with the notions of observable, measurement, and time evolution of state, provide a model that can be used for sound processing, in both directions of analysis and synthesis. QVTS can give a quantum-theoretic explanation to some auditory streaming phenomena, eventually leading to practical solutions of relevant sound-processing problems, or it can be creatively exploited to manipulate superpositions of sonic elements. Perhaps more importantly, QVTS may be a fertile ground to host a dialogue between physicists, computer scientists, musicians, and sound designers, possibly giving us unheard manifestations of human creativity.</summary>

    <summary>Audio-visual navigation task requires an agent to find a sound source in a realistic, unmapped 3D environment by utilizing egocentric audio-visual observations. Existing audio-visual navigation works assume a clean environment that solely contains the target sound, which, however, would not be suitable in most real-world applications due to the unexpected sound noise or intentional interference. In this work, we design an acoustically complex environment in which, besides the target sound, there exists a sound attacker playing a zero-sum game with the agent. More specifically, the attacker can move and change the volume and category of the sound to make the agent suffer from finding the sounding object while the agent tries to dodge the attack and navigate to the goal under the intervention. Under certain constraints to the attacker, we can improve the robustness of the agent towards unexpected sound attacks in audio-visual navigation. For better convergence, we develop a joint training mechanism by employing the property of a centralized critic with decentralized actors. Experiments on two real-world 3D scan datasets, Replica, and Matterport3D, verify the effectiveness and the robustness of the agent trained under our designed environment when transferred to the clean environment or the one containing sound attackers with random policy.

    <title>Sampling Theory of Jointly Bandlimited Time-vertex Graph Signals</title>

    <summary>Time-vertex graph signal (TVGS) models describe time-varying data with irregular structures. The bandlimitedness in the joint time-vertex Fourier spectral domain reflects smoothness in both temporal and graph topology. In this paper, we study the critical sampling of three types of TVGS including continuous-time signals, infinite-length sequences, and finite-length sequences in the time domain for each vertex on the graph. For a jointly bandlimited TVGS, we prove a lower bound on sampling density or sampling ratio, which depends on the measure of the spectral support in the joint time-vertex Fourier spectral domain. We also provide a lower bound on the sampling density or sampling ratio of each vertex on sampling sets for perfect recovery. To demonstrate that critical sampling is achievable, we propose the sampling and reconstruction procedures for the different types of TVGS. Finally, we show how the proposed sampling schemes can be applied to numerical as well as real datasets.</summary>

    <title>ECHO: Environmental Sound Classification with Hierarchical Ontology-guided Semi-Supervised Learning</title>
    <updated>2024-09-21T07:08:57Z</updated>

    <summary>Environment Sound Classification has been a well-studied research problem in the field of signal processing and up till now more focus has been laid on fully supervised approaches. Over the last few years, focus has moved towards semi-supervised methods which concentrate on the utilization of unlabeled data, and self-supervised methods which learn the intermediate representation through pretext task or contrastive learning. However, both approaches require a vast amount of unlabelled data to improve performance. In this work, we propose a novel framework called Environmental Sound Classification with Hierarchical Ontology-guided semi-supervised Learning (ECHO) that utilizes label ontology-based hierarchy to learn semantic representation by defining a novel pretext task. In the pretext task, the model tries to predict coarse labels defined by the Large Language Model (LLM) based on ground truth label ontology. The trained model is further fine-tuned in a supervised way to predict the actual task. Our proposed novel semi-supervised framework achieves an accuracy improvement in the range of 1\% to 8\% over baseline systems across three datasets namely UrbanSound8K, ESC-10, and ESC-50.</summary>
