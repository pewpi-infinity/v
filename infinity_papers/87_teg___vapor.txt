    <summary>The performance of a combined solar photovoltaic (PV) and thermoelectric generator (TEG) system is examined using an analytical model for four different types of commercial PVs and a commercial bismuth telluride TEG. The TEG is applied directly on the back of the PV, so that the two devices have the same temperature. The PVs considered are crystalline Si (c-Si), amorphous Si (a-Si), copper indium gallium (di)selenide (CIGS) and cadmium telluride (CdTe) cells. The degradation of PV performance with temperature is shown to dominate the increase in power produced by the TEG, due to the low efficiency of the TEG. For c-Si, CIGS and CdTe PV cells the combined system produces a lower power and has a lower efficiency than the PV alone, whereas for an a-Si cell the total system performance may be slightly increased by the TEG.</summary>

    <summary>Anomaly detection in video surveillance has recently gained interest from the research community. Temporal duration of anomalies vary within video streams, leading to complications in learning the temporal dynamics of specific events. This paper presents a temporal-granularity method for an anomaly detection model (TeG) in real-world surveillance, combining spatio-temporal features at different time-scales. The TeG model employs multi-head cross-attention blocks and multi-head self-attention blocks for this purpose. Additionally, we extend the UCF-Crime dataset with new anomaly types relevant to Smart City research project. The TeG model is deployed and validated in a city surveillance system, achieving successful real-time results in industrial settings.</summary>

    <title>Growth temperature dependence of partially Fe filled MWCNT using chemical vapor deposition</title>
    <updated>2019-08-02T08:40:52Z</updated>

    <summary>This investigation deals with the effect of growth temperature on the growth behavior of Fe filled multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). Carbon nanotube (CNT) synthesis was carried out in a thermal chemical vapor deposition (CVD) reactor in the temperature range 650 to 950 1C using propane as the carbon source, Fe as the catalyst material, and Si as the catalyst support. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis of the catalyst exhibits that at elevated temperature clusters of catalyst coalesce and form macroscopic islands. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) results show that with increased growth temperature the average diameter of the nanotubes increases but their density decreases. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) studies suggest that the nanotubes have multi-walled structure with partial Fe filling for all growth temperatures. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the grown materials indicates that they are graphitic in nature. The characterization of nanotubes by Raman spectroscopy reveals that the optimized growth temperature for Fe filled CNTs is 850 1C, in terms of quality. A simple model for the growth of Fe filled carbon nanotubes is proposed.</summary>

    <title>TEG-DB: A Comprehensive Dataset and Benchmark of Textual-Edge Graphs</title>
    <updated>2024-11-25T13:35:47Z</updated>

    <summary>Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) augment graph structures with natural language descriptions, facilitating detailed depictions of data and their interconnections across various real-world settings. However, existing TAG datasets predominantly feature textual information only at the nodes, with edges typically represented by mere binary or categorical attributes. This lack of rich textual edge annotations significantly limits the exploration of contextual relationships between entities, hindering deeper insights into graph-structured data. To address this gap, we introduce Textual-Edge Graphs Datasets and Benchmark (TEG-DB), a comprehensive and diverse collection of benchmark textual-edge datasets featuring rich textual descriptions on nodes and edges. The TEG-DB datasets are large-scale and encompass a wide range of domains, from citation networks to social networks. In addition, we conduct extensive benchmark experiments on TEG-DB to assess the extent to which current techniques, including pre-trained language models, graph neural networks, and their combinations, can utilize textual node and edge information. Our goal is to elicit advancements in textual-edge graph research, specifically in developing methodologies that exploit rich textual node and edge descriptions to enhance graph analysis and provide deeper insights into complex real-world networks. The entire TEG-DB project is publicly accessible as an open-source repository on Github, accessible at https://github.com/Zhuofeng-Li/TEG-Benchmark.</summary>

    <title>Increased stability of CuZrAl metallic glasses prepared by physical vapor deposition</title>
    <updated>2017-09-14T13:55:25Z</updated>

    <summary>We carried out molecular dynamics simulations (MD) using realistic empirical potentials for the vapor deposition (VD) of CuZrAl glasses. VD glasses have higher densities and lower potential and inherent structure energies than the melt-quenched glasses for the same alloys. The optimal substrate temperature for the deposition process is 0.625$\times T_\mathrm{g}$. In VD metallic glasses (MGs), the total number of icosahedral like clusters is higher than in the melt-quenched MGs. Surprisingly, the VD glasses have a lower degree of chemical mixing than the melt-quenched glasses. The reason for it is that the melt-quenched MGs can be viewed as frozen liquids, which means that their chemical order is the same as in the liquid state. In contrast, during the formation of the VD MGs, the absence of the liquid state results in the creation of a different chemical order with more Zr-Zr homonuclear bonds compared with the melt-quenched MGs. In order to obtain MGs from melt-quench technique with similarly low energies as in the VD process, the cooling rate during quenching would have to be many orders of magnitude lower than currently accessible to MD simulations. The method proposed in this manuscript is a more efficient way to create MGs by using MD simulations.</summary>
