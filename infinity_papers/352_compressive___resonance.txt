    <summary>  We describe a quasi-optical multifrequency ESR spectrometer operating in the 75-225 GHz range and optimized at 210 GHz for general use in condensed matter physics, chemistry and biology. The quasi-optical bridge detects the change of mm wave polarization at the ESR. A controllable reference arm maintains a mm wave bias at the detector. The attained sensitivity of 2x10^10 spin/G/(Hz)1/2, measured on a dilute Mn:MgO sample in a non-resonant probe head at 222.4 GHz and 300 K, is comparable to commercial high sensitive X band spectrometers. The spectrometer has a Fabry-Perot resonator based probe head to measure aqueous solutions, and a probe head to measure magnetic field angular dependence of single crystals. The spectrometer is robust and easy to use and may be operated by undergraduate students. Its performance is demonstrated by examples from various fields of condensed matter physics.</summary>

    <summary>Magnetic resonance imaging with hyperpolarized contrast agents can provide unprecedented \textit{in-vivo} measurements of metabolism, but yields images that are lower resolution than that achieved with proton anatomical imaging. In order to spatially localize the metabolic activity, the metabolic image must be interpolated to the size of the proton image. The most common methods for choosing the unknown values rely exclusively on values of the original un-interpolated image. In this work, we present an alternative method that uses the higher-resolution proton image to provide additional spatial structure. The interpolated image is the result of a convex optimization algorithm which is solved with the Fast Iterative Shrinkage Threshold Algorithm (FISTA). Results are shown with images of hyperpolarized pyruvate, lactate, and bicarbonate using data of the heart and brain from healthy human volunteers, a healthy porcine heart, and a human with prostate cancer.</summary>

    <title>Noncontrast free-breathing respiratory self-navigated coronary artery cardiovascular magnetic resonance angiography at 3 T using lipid insensitive binomial off-resonant excitation (LIBRE)</title>

    <summary>Robust and homogeneous lipid suppression is mandatory for coronary magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) since coronary arteries are commonly embedded in fat. However, effective large volume lipid suppression becomes challenging when performing radial whole-heart coronary MRA and the problem may even be exacerbated at increasing magnetic field strengths. Incomplete fat suppression also generates artifacts, and may affect advanced motion correction methods. The aim was to evaluate a recently reported lipid insensitive MRI method for self-navigated coronary MRA at 3T. Lipid insensitive binomial off resonant excitation (LIBRE) radiofrequency (RF) excitation pulses were included into a self-navigated 3D radial GRE coronary MRA sequence at 3T. LIBRE was compared against conventional fat saturation (FS) and binomial 1-180°-1 water excitation (WE). First, fat suppression of all techniques was numerically characterized using Matlab and experimentally validated in phantoms and in legs of human volunteers. Subsequently, free-breathing self-navigated coronary MRA was performed using the LIBRE pulse as well as FS and WE in ten volunteers. Results obtained in the simulations were confirmed by the experimental validations as LIBRE enabled near complete fat suppression for 3D radial imaging in vitro and in vivo. For self-navigated whole-heart coronary MRA at 3T, fat SNR was significantly attenuated using LIBRE compared with conventional FS. LIBRE increased the RCA vessel sharpness significantly (37 +/- 9% (LIBRE) vs. 29 +/- 8% (FS) and 30 +/- 8% (WE), both p&lt;0.05) and led to a significant increase in the measured RCA vessel length to (83 +/- 31 mm (LIBRE) vs. 56 +/- 12 mm (FS) and 59 +/- 27 (WE) p&lt;0.05). LIBRE enables robust large volume fat suppression and significantly improves coronary artery image quality at 3T compared to the use of conventional fat suppression and water excitation.</summary>

    <summary>  We survey a new paradigm in signal processing known as "compressive sensing". Contrary to old practices of data acquisition and reconstruction based on the Shannon-Nyquist sampling principle, the new theory shows that it is possible to reconstruct images or signals of scientific interest accurately and even exactly from a number of samples which is far smaller than the desired resolution of the image/signal, e.g., the number of pixels in the image. This new technique draws from results in several fields of mathematics, including algebra, optimization, probability theory, and harmonic analysis. We will discuss some of the key mathematical ideas behind compressive sensing, as well as its implications to other fields: numerical analysis, information theory, theoretical computer science, and engineering.</summary>

    <summary>We describe a general framework -- compressive statistical learning -- for resource-efficient large-scale learning: the training collection is compressed in one pass into a low-dimensional sketch (a vector of random empirical generalized moments) that captures the information relevant to the considered learning task. A near-minimizer of the risk is computed from the sketch through the solution of a nonlinear least squares problem. We investigate sufficient sketch sizes to control the generalization error of this procedure. The framework is illustrated on compressive PCA, compressive clustering, and compressive Gaussian mixture Modeling with fixed known variance. The latter two are further developed in a companion paper.</summary>
