    <summary>A classical problem in power systems is to allocate in-coming (elastic or inelastic) demands without violating the operating constraints of electric networks in an online fashion. Although online decision problems have been well-studied in the literature, a unique challenge arising in power systems is the presence of non-linear constraints, a departure from the traditional settings. A particular example is the capacity constraint of apparent power, which gives rise to a quadratic constraint, rather than typical linear constraints. In this paper, we present a competitive randomized online algorithm for deciding whether a sequence of inelastic demands can be allocated for the requested intervals, subject to the total satisfiable apparent power within a time-varying capacity constraint. We also consider an alternative setting with nodal voltage constraint, using a variant of the online algorithm. Finally, simulation studies are provided to evaluate the algorithms empirically.</summary>

    <summary>Ref.[BCOW17] introduced a pioneering quantum approach (coined BCOW algorithm) for solving linear differential equations with optimal error tolerance. Originally designed for a specific class of diagonalizable linear differential equations, the algorithm was extended by Krovi in [Kro23] to encompass broader classes, including non-diagonalizable and even singular matrices. Despite the common misconception, the original algorithm is indeed applicable to non-diagonalizable matrices, with diagonalisation primarily serving for theoretical analyses to establish bounds on condition number and solution error. By leveraging basic estimates from [Kro23], we derive bounds comparable to those outlined in the Krovi algorithm, thereby reinstating the advantages of the BCOW approach. Furthermore, we extend the BCOW algorithm to address time-dependent linear differential equations by transforming non-autonomous systems into higher-dimensional autonomous ones, a technique also applicable for the Krovi algorithm.</summary>

    <summary>  This paper presents a gradient based motion estimation algorithm based on shape-motion prediction, which takes advantage of the correlation between neighboring Binary Alpha Blocks (BABs), to match with the Mpeg-4 shape coding case and speed up the estimation process. The PSNR and computation time achieved by the proposed algorithm seem to be better than those obtained by most popular motion estimation techniques.</summary>

    <title>Solving the encoding bottleneck: of the HHL algorithm, by the HHL algorithm</title>
    <updated>2025-03-09T10:29:36Z</updated>

    <summary>The Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm offers exponential speedup for solving the quantum linear-system problem. But some caveats for the speedup could be hard to met. One of the difficulties is the encoding bottleneck, i.e., the efficient preparation of the initial quantum state. To prepare an arbitrary $N$-dimensional state exactly, existing state-preparation approaches generally require a runtime of $O(N)$, which will ruin the speedup of the HHL algorithm. Here we show that the states can be prepared approximately with a runtime of $O(poly(\log N))$ by employing a slightly modified version of the HHL algorithm itself. Thus, applying this approach to prepare the initial state of the original HHL algorithm can preserve the exponential speedup advantage. It can also serve as a standalone solution for other applications demanding fast state preparation.</summary>
