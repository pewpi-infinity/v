    <summary>This investigation deals with the effect of growth temperature on the growth behavior of Fe filled multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). Carbon nanotube (CNT) synthesis was carried out in a thermal chemical vapor deposition (CVD) reactor in the temperature range 650 to 950 1C using propane as the carbon source, Fe as the catalyst material, and Si as the catalyst support. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis of the catalyst exhibits that at elevated temperature clusters of catalyst coalesce and form macroscopic islands. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) results show that with increased growth temperature the average diameter of the nanotubes increases but their density decreases. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) studies suggest that the nanotubes have multi-walled structure with partial Fe filling for all growth temperatures. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the grown materials indicates that they are graphitic in nature. The characterization of nanotubes by Raman spectroscopy reveals that the optimized growth temperature for Fe filled CNTs is 850 1C, in terms of quality. A simple model for the growth of Fe filled carbon nanotubes is proposed.</summary>

    <summary>A classical problem in power systems is to allocate in-coming (elastic or inelastic) demands without violating the operating constraints of electric networks in an online fashion. Although online decision problems have been well-studied in the literature, a unique challenge arising in power systems is the presence of non-linear constraints, a departure from the traditional settings. A particular example is the capacity constraint of apparent power, which gives rise to a quadratic constraint, rather than typical linear constraints. In this paper, we present a competitive randomized online algorithm for deciding whether a sequence of inelastic demands can be allocated for the requested intervals, subject to the total satisfiable apparent power within a time-varying capacity constraint. We also consider an alternative setting with nodal voltage constraint, using a variant of the online algorithm. Finally, simulation studies are provided to evaluate the algorithms empirically.</summary>

    <summary>Ref.[BCOW17] introduced a pioneering quantum approach (coined BCOW algorithm) for solving linear differential equations with optimal error tolerance. Originally designed for a specific class of diagonalizable linear differential equations, the algorithm was extended by Krovi in [Kro23] to encompass broader classes, including non-diagonalizable and even singular matrices. Despite the common misconception, the original algorithm is indeed applicable to non-diagonalizable matrices, with diagonalisation primarily serving for theoretical analyses to establish bounds on condition number and solution error. By leveraging basic estimates from [Kro23], we derive bounds comparable to those outlined in the Krovi algorithm, thereby reinstating the advantages of the BCOW approach. Furthermore, we extend the BCOW algorithm to address time-dependent linear differential equations by transforming non-autonomous systems into higher-dimensional autonomous ones, a technique also applicable for the Krovi algorithm.</summary>

    <summary>  This paper presents a gradient based motion estimation algorithm based on shape-motion prediction, which takes advantage of the correlation between neighboring Binary Alpha Blocks (BABs), to match with the Mpeg-4 shape coding case and speed up the estimation process. The PSNR and computation time achieved by the proposed algorithm seem to be better than those obtained by most popular motion estimation techniques.</summary>
