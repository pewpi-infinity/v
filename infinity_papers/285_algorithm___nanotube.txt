    <summary>Energetic ion irradiation is an effective method for studying how single and multi-shelled carbon nanotubes break apart. The energy from ions is dissipated through both linear and nonlinear processes in the nanotubes, leading to defect formation. Fragmentation occurs via atomic collision cascades and thermal spikes, each described by different theoretical models. Experiments with Cs-irradiated nanotubes support these models, and an information-theoretic approach further explains the fragmentation mechanisms. Sputtered species yield probability distributions, which are analyzed using Shannon entropy and fractal dimension to assess spatial characteristics. Kullback-Leibler divergence helps identify the diversity of emission mechanisms. Together, thermal and information-theoretic models clarify and distinguish the roles of collision cascades and thermal spikes in nanotube fragmentation.</summary>

    <summary>  Nanotube-based systems are good candidates for optical limiting against broadband laser pulses. We explore new routes to improve their limiting performances. We show that the diameter of the nanotubes is a key factor to control the performances. On the other hand, we demonstrate that chemically modified nanotubes can be mixed with organic chromophores, leading to high performance composite limiting systems which are particularly efficient in the nanosecond regime due to the cumulative effects of nonlinear scattering and multiphoton absorption.</summary>

    <summary>Growth of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) was performed by atmospheric pressure chemical vapour deposition (APCVD) of propane on Si(111) with a pre-treated Ni overlayer acting as a catalyst. Prior to the growth of CNTs, a thin film of Ni was deposited on Si(111) substrate by evaporation and heat treated at 900°C. The growth of nanotubes was carried out at 850°C using propane as a source of carbon. Distribution of the catalyst particles over the Si substrate was analysed before and after heat treatment by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the grown material revealed that they are graphitic in nature. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) was used to investigate the growth process and it was found that a catalytic particle was always situated at the tip of the tube thus implying a tip growth mechanism. Evidence for the presence of radial breathing mode from multi-wall nanotubes (MWNTs) in the grown sample was obtained from micro-Raman analysis. Finally, high-resolution transmission electron microscopic (HRTEM) analysis confirmed that the graphene layers of the CNTs are well ordered with typical 0.34 nm spacing.</summary>

    <summary>  A simple model is developed to predict the complex mechanical properties of carbon nanotube sheets (buckypaper) [Hall \textit{et al.}, \textit{Science} \textbf{320} 504 (2008)]. Fabricated using a similar method to that deployed for making writing paper, these buckypapers can have in-plane Poisson's ratios changed from positive to negative, becoming auxetic, as multiwalled carbon nanotubes are increasingly mixed with single-walled carbon nanotubes. Essential structural features of the buckypapers are incorporated into the model: isotropic in-plane mechanical properties, nanotubes preferentially oriented in the sheet plane, and freedom to undergo stress-induced elongation by both angle and length changes. The expressions derived for the Poisson's ratios enabled quantitative prediction of both observed properties and remarkable new properties obtainable by structural modification.</summary>

    <summary>Recently, short channel effects (SCE) and power consumption dissipation problems pose big challenges which need imperative actions to be taken to deal with for field effect transistor to further scale down as semiconductor technology enters into sub-10nm technology node. From 3nm technology node and beyond, gate all around field effect transistor steps onto the history stage attributed to its improved SCE suppressing ability thanks to surrounding gate structure. Herein, we demonstrate the super electrostatic control ability of a double-gated nanotube gate all around field effect transistor (DG NT GAAFET) in comparison with nanotube (NT GAAFET) and nanowire gate all around field effect transistor (NW GAAFET) with the same device parameters designed. Ion boosts of 62% and 57% have been obtained in DG NT GAAFET in comparison with those of NT GAAFET and NW GAAFET. Besides, substantially suppressed SCEs have been obtained in DG NT GAAFET due to enhanced electrostatic control, which are certificated by improved Ioff, SS, and Ion/Ioff ratio obtained. On the other hand, the Ion of NT GAAFET is comparable with that of NW GAA-FET. Whereas, its Ioff is 1 order smaller, and SS is almost 2 times smaller compared with those of NW GAA-FET, manifesting the meliority of nanotube channel structure. In the end, the robustness of nanotube channel structure, especially double gated one, against Lg scaling has been verified with TCAD simulation study.</summary>
