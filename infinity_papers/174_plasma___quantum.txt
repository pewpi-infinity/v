    <summary>Wave-particle interaction (WPI) is one of the most fundamental processes in plasma physics in which one most prominent example is the Landau damping. Owing to its excellent energy-exchange mechanism, the WPI has gained increasing interest not only from theoretical points of view but also its many important applications including plasma heating and plasma acceleration. In this review work, we present theoretical backgrounds of linear and nonlinear wave-particle interactions in quantum plasmas. Specifically, we focus on the wave-particle interactions for homogeneous plasma waves (i.e., waves with infinite extent rather than a localized pulse) as well as for propagating electrostatic waves in the weak and strong quantum regimes to demonstrate the modifications of several classical features including those associated with resonant and trapped particles. Finally, the future perspectives of WPI in quantum plasmas are presented.</summary>

    <title>A critique of recent semi-classical spin-half quantum plasma theories</title>

    <summary>Certain recent semi-classical theories of spin-half quantum plasmas are examined with regard to their internal consistency, physical applicability and relevance to fusion, astrophysical and condensed matter plasmas. It is shown that the derivations and some of the results obtained in these theories are internally inconsistent and contradict well-established principles of quantum and statistical mechanics, especially in their treatment of fermions and spin. Claims of large semi-classical effects of spin magnetic moments that could dominate the plasma dynamics are found to be invalid both for single-particles and collectively. Larmor moments dominate at high temperature while spin moments cancel due to Pauli blocking at low temperatures. Explicit numerical estimates from a variety of plasmas are provided to demonstrate that spin effects are indeed much smaller than many neglected classical effects. The analysis presented suggests that the aforementioned `Spin Quantum Hydrodynamic' theories are not relevant to conventional laboratory or astrophysical plasmas.</summary>

    <summary>Wavelet analysis and compression tools are reviewed and different applications to study MHD and plasma turbulence are presented. We introduce the continuous and the orthogonal wavelet transform and detail several statistical diagnostics based on the wavelet coefficients. We then show how to extract coherent structures out of fully developed turbulent flows using wavelet-based denoising. Finally some multiscale numerical simulation schemes using wavelets are described. Several examples for analyzing, compressing and computing one, two and three dimensional turbulent MHD or plasma flows are presented.</summary>

    <summary>We study the dispersion properties of surface plasmon oscillations in a semi-bounded semiconductor plasma with the effects of the Coulomb exchange force associated with the spin polarization of electrons and holes as well as the effects of the Fermi degenerate pressure and the quantum Bohm potential. Starting from a quantum hydrodynamic (QHD) model coupled to the Poisson equation, we derive the general dispersion relation for surface plasma waves. Previous results in this context are recovered. The dispersion properties of the surface waves are analyzed in some particular cases of interest and the relative influence of the quantum forces on these waves are also studied for a nano-sized GaAs semiconductor plasma. It is found that the Coulomb exchange effects significantly modify the behaviors of the surface plasmon waves. The present results are applicable to understand the propagation characteristics of surface waves in solid density plasmas.</summary>

    <summary>Extreme-ultraviolet pulses can propagate through ionised solid-density targets, unlike optical pulses and, thus, have the potential to probe the interior of such plasmas on sub-femtosecond timescales. We present a synthetic diagnostic method for solid-density laser-generated plasmas based on the dispersion of an extreme-ultraviolet attosecond probe pulse, in a pump--probe scheme. We demonstrate the theoretical feasibility of this approach through calculating the dispersion of an extreme-ultraviolet probe pulse propagating through a laser-generated plasma. The plasma dynamics is calculated using a particle-in-cell simulation, whereas the dispersion of the probe is calculated with an external pseudo-spectral wave solver, allowing for high accuracy when calculating the dispersion. The application of this method is illustrated on thin-film plastic and aluminium targets irradiated by a high-intensity pump pulse. By comparing the dispersion of the probe pulse at different delays relative to the pump pulse, it is possible to follow the evolution of the plasma as it disintegrates. The high-frequency end of the dispersion provides information on the line-integrated electron density, whereas lower frequencies are more affected by the highest density encountered along the path of the probe. In addition, the presence of thin-film interference could be used to study the evolution of the plasma surface.</summary>
