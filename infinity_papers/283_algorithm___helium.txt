    <summary>  Liquid helium is crucial to conveniently vary magnetic field (H) and temperature (T) giving access to a large region of (H, T) space; in stark contrast with the effort currently required to explore a comparable region of (P, T) space. The centenary of the liquefaction of helium is an appropriate occasion to talk on the utilization of our facilities for studies across first order phase transitions. We observed some interesting effects in variety of systems traversing (H, T) space across the magnetic first order phase transitions. We focus here on a few recent intriguing discoveries in the half-doped manganites related to the coexistence of equilibrium phase, with a glass-like phase having both structural and magnetic long-range order.</summary>

    <summary>  A high-resolution study of the (e,e'p) reaction on Helium-4 was carried out at the Institut fuer Kernphysik in Mainz, Germany. The measurements were done in parallel kinematics (momentum transfer q=685 MeV/c, energy transfer omega=334 MeV) at different incident beam energies in order to enable the Rosenbluth separation of the longitudinal and transverse response functions.</summary>

    <summary>  Helium nanodroplets and trapped Bose-Einstein condensates in dilute atomic gases offer complementary views of fundamental aspects of quantum many-body systems. We discuss analogies and differences, stressing their common theoretical background and peculiar features. We briefly review some relevant concepts, such as the meaning of superfluidity in finite systems, the behavior of elementary excitations and collective modes, as well as rotational properties and quantized vorticity.</summary>

    <summary>  Euclidean space and linear algebra do not characterize dynamic electronic orbitals satisfactorily for even the motion of both electrons in an inert helium atom cannot be defined in reasonable details. Here the author puts forward a novel two-dimensional spacetime model from scratch in the context of defining both electrons in a helium atom. Space and time are treated as two orthogonal, symmetric and complementary quantities under the atomic spacetime. Electronic motion observed the rule of differential and integral operations that were implemented by dynamic trigonometric functions. It is demonstrated that the atomic spacetime is not a linear vector space with Newtonian time, and within which calculus has non-classical definition, and complex wave functions have fresh physical significances. This alternative approach is original, informative and refreshing but still compatible with quantum mechanics in the formulation. The description of electronic resonance in helium is also comparable with classical mechanics such as an oscillating pendulum and with classical electromagnetism such as an LC oscillator. The study has effectively unified complex function, calculus, and trigonometry in mathematics, and provided a prospect for unifying particle physics with classical physics on the novel spacetime platform.</summary>

    <summary>  The problem studied in this paper is to obtain the equations describing sound propagation in a consolidated porous medium filled with superfluid, determine the elastic coefficients, appearing in the equations, in terms of physically measurable quantities, and calculate the propagation velocities of transverse and longitudinal waves at high and low oscillating frequencies. In general, the obtained equations describe all volume modes that can propagate in a porous medium saturated with superfluid for any values of the porosity and frequencies. The derived equations are applied to the most important particular case when the normal component of superfluid helium is locked inside a highly porous media (aerogel, Im-helium sample) by viscous forces. For this case the velocities of two longitudinal sound modes and transverse mode are calculated from the derived equations. There are established the coupling between temperature and pressure oscillations in these fast and slow modes.</summary>
