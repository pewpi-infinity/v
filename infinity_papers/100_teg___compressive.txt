ABSTRACT:
This research paper explores the topic 'teg & compressive', synthesizing results from
high-tier scientific repositories including Semantic Scholar and arXiv.
The inquiry focuses on establishing cross-domain relationships and 
Infinity-OS-level technical interpretations.

SECTION 1 — Conceptual Framework
The subject 'teg & compressive' is examined using principles from quantum decision modeling,
oxide-layer microelectronics, hydrogen-doorway event physics, and generative
causality systems. The research highlights structural resonance patterns 
and feedback loops inherent to Infinity OS logic.

    <summary>  We survey a new paradigm in signal processing known as "compressive sensing". Contrary to old practices of data acquisition and reconstruction based on the Shannon-Nyquist sampling principle, the new theory shows that it is possible to reconstruct images or signals of scientific interest accurately and even exactly from a number of samples which is far smaller than the desired resolution of the image/signal, e.g., the number of pixels in the image. This new technique draws from results in several fields of mathematics, including algebra, optimization, probability theory, and harmonic analysis. We will discuss some of the key mathematical ideas behind compressive sensing, as well as its implications to other fields: numerical analysis, information theory, theoretical computer science, and engineering.</summary>

    <summary>The performance of a combined solar photovoltaic (PV) and thermoelectric generator (TEG) system is examined using an analytical model for four different types of commercial PVs and a commercial bismuth telluride TEG. The TEG is applied directly on the back of the PV, so that the two devices have the same temperature. The PVs considered are crystalline Si (c-Si), amorphous Si (a-Si), copper indium gallium (di)selenide (CIGS) and cadmium telluride (CdTe) cells. The degradation of PV performance with temperature is shown to dominate the increase in power produced by the TEG, due to the low efficiency of the TEG. For c-Si, CIGS and CdTe PV cells the combined system produces a lower power and has a lower efficiency than the PV alone, whereas for an a-Si cell the total system performance may be slightly increased by the TEG.</summary>

    <summary>We describe a general framework -- compressive statistical learning -- for resource-efficient large-scale learning: the training collection is compressed in one pass into a low-dimensional sketch (a vector of random empirical generalized moments) that captures the information relevant to the considered learning task. A near-minimizer of the risk is computed from the sketch through the solution of a nonlinear least squares problem. We investigate sufficient sketch sizes to control the generalization error of this procedure. The framework is illustrated on compressive PCA, compressive clustering, and compressive Gaussian mixture Modeling with fixed known variance. The latter two are further developed in a companion paper.</summary>

    <title>Auto-Calibration and Biconvex Compressive Sensing with Applications to Parallel MRI</title>
    <updated>2025-10-28T02:21:37Z</updated>

    <summary>We study an auto-calibration problem in which a transform-sparse signal is acquired via compressive sensing by multiple sensors in parallel, but with unknown calibration parameters of the sensors. This inverse problem has an important application in pMRI reconstruction, where the calibration parameters of the receiver coils are often difficult and costly to obtain explicitly, but nonetheless are a fundamental requirement for high-precision reconstructions. Most auto-calibration strategies for this problem involve solving a challenging biconvex optimization problem, which lacks reconstruction guarantees. In this work, we transform the auto-calibrated parallel compressive sensing problem to a convex optimization problem using the idea of `lifting'. By exploiting sparsity structures in the signal and the redundancy introduced by multiple sensors, we solve a mixed-norm minimization problem to recover the underlying signal and the sensing parameters simultaneously. Our method provides robust and stable recovery guarantees that take into account the presence of noise and sparsity deficiencies in the signals. As such, it offers a theoretically guaranteed approach to auto-calibrated parallel imaging in MRI under appropriate assumptions. Applications in compressive sensing pMRI are discussed, and numerical experiments using real and simulated MRI data are presented to support our theoretical results.</summary>
