    <summary>The effect of changes in plasma parameters, that are characteristic near or at an L-H transition in fusion edge plasmas, on fluctuation correlation lengths are analysed by means of drift-Alfven turbulence computations. Scalings by density gradient length, collisionality, plasma beta, and by an imposed shear flow are considered. It is found that strongly sheared flows lead to the appearence of long-range correlations in electrostatic potential fluctuations parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field.</summary>

    <summary>  Propagation of intense laser beams is crucial for inertial confinement fusion, which requires precise beam control to achieve the compression and heating necessary to ignite the fusion reaction. The National Ignition Facility (NIF), where fusion will be attempted, is now under construction. Control of intense beam propagation may be ruined by laser beam self-focusing. We have identified the maximum laser beam power that can propagate through fusion plasma without significant self-focusing and have found excellent agreement with recent experimental data, and suggest a way to increase that maximum by appropriate choice of plasma composition with implication for NIF designs. Our theory also leads to the prediction of anti-correlation between beam spray and backscatter and suggests the indirect control of backscatter through manipulation of plasma ionization state or acoustic damping.</summary>

    <title>Ion cyclotron emission from fusion-born ions in large tokamak plasmas: a brief review from JET and TFTR to ITER</title>

    <summary>Ion cyclotron emission (ICE) was the first collective radiative instability, driven by confined fusion-born ions, observed from deuterium-tritium plasmas in JET and TFTR. ICE comprises strongly suprathermal emission, which has spectral peaks at multiple ion cyclotron harmonic frequencies as evaluated at the outer mid-plane edge of tokamak plasmas. The measured intensity of ICE spectral peaks scaled linearly with measured fusion reactivity in JET. In other large tokamak plasmas, ICE is currently used as an indicator of fast ions physics. The excitation mechanism for ICE is the magnetoacoustic cyclotron instability (MCI); in the case of JET and TFTR, the MCI is driven by a set of centrally born fusion products, lying just inside the trapped-passing boundary in velocity space, whose drift orbits make large radial excursions to the outer mid-plane edge. Diagnostic exploitation of ICE in future experiments therefore rests in part on deep understanding of the MCI, and recent advances in computational plasma physics have led to substantial recent progress, reviewed here.</summary>

    <title>Sandpile modelling of dual location fuelling in fusion plasmas</title>

    <summary>We modify the Chapman sandpile model (Chapman \textit{et al} \textit{Physical Review Letters} 86, 2814 (2001)) to form comparisons with pellet pacing, which is used to reduce or eliminate ELMs in a fusion plasma. We employ a variation of that model in which a pedestal with feedback is introduced (Bowie and Hole \textit{Phys. Plasmas} 25, 012511 (2018)), which we further modify to provide for dual fuelling - sand is added both at the centre of the sandpile, and near the edge. We observe that when the additional sand is added at the top of the pedestal, MLEs are largely suppressed. While this suppression comes at a cost by way of reduction in total energy confinement, that reduction is lower than the reduction in MLE size. The trade-off between MLE suppression and reduction in energy confinement depends not only on the amount of extra sand, but also on its precise location relative to the top of the pedestal. We suggest that the approach of constant dual fuelling may be equally applicable to plasmas, and may suggest a strategy for ELM suppression in fusion plasmas. We observe that when the proposed amount of extra sand is added in 'pellets', using frequencies and amounts based on those proposed for ELM suppression for ITER, MLEs are similarly suppressed, although MLEs are not significantly suppressed when the pellet rate does not substantially exceed the MLE frequency. This suggests that pellet injection at the top of the pedestal at small pellet size and high frequency may represent a reasonable physical proxy for our proposed scheme. However, our results suggest that it is not the synchronisation of pellets to ELM frequencies which is the key factor for ELM suppression in this regime, but rather the introduction of additional fuelling at the top of the pedestal.</summary>

    <title>Magnetized Plasma Target for Plasma-Jet-Driven Magneto-Inertial Fusion</title>

    <summary>We identify the desired characteristics and parameters of a beta&gt;1 magnetized plasma, possibly with highly tangled, open field lines, that could be a suitable target to be compressed to fusion conditions by a spherically imploding plasma liner [S. C. Hsu et al., IEEE Trans. Plasma Sci. 40, 1287 (2012)] formed by merging hypersonic plasma jets. This concept is known as plasma-jet-driven magneto-inertial fusion (PJMIF). We set requirements on the target and liner such that (a) compressional heating dominates over thermal transport in the target, and (b) magnetic amplification due to compression dominates over dissipation over the entire implosion. We also evaluate the requirements to avoid drift-instability-induced anomalous transport and current-driven anomalous resistivity in the target. Next, we describe possible approaches to create such a magnetized, beta&gt;1 plasma target. Finally, assuming such a target can be created, we evaluate the feasibility of a proof-of-concept experiment using presently achievable plasma jets to demonstrate target compressional heating at a plasma-liner kinetic energy of &lt;~ 100 kJ (a few hundred times below that needed in a PJMIF reactor).</summary>
