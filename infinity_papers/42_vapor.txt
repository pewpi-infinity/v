    <summary>This investigation deals with the effect of growth temperature on the growth behavior of Fe filled multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). Carbon nanotube (CNT) synthesis was carried out in a thermal chemical vapor deposition (CVD) reactor in the temperature range 650 to 950 1C using propane as the carbon source, Fe as the catalyst material, and Si as the catalyst support. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis of the catalyst exhibits that at elevated temperature clusters of catalyst coalesce and form macroscopic islands. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) results show that with increased growth temperature the average diameter of the nanotubes increases but their density decreases. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) studies suggest that the nanotubes have multi-walled structure with partial Fe filling for all growth temperatures. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the grown materials indicates that they are graphitic in nature. The characterization of nanotubes by Raman spectroscopy reveals that the optimized growth temperature for Fe filled CNTs is 850 1C, in terms of quality. A simple model for the growth of Fe filled carbon nanotubes is proposed.</summary>

    <summary>We carried out molecular dynamics simulations (MD) using realistic empirical potentials for the vapor deposition (VD) of CuZrAl glasses. VD glasses have higher densities and lower potential and inherent structure energies than the melt-quenched glasses for the same alloys. The optimal substrate temperature for the deposition process is 0.625$\times T_\mathrm{g}$. In VD metallic glasses (MGs), the total number of icosahedral like clusters is higher than in the melt-quenched MGs. Surprisingly, the VD glasses have a lower degree of chemical mixing than the melt-quenched glasses. The reason for it is that the melt-quenched MGs can be viewed as frozen liquids, which means that their chemical order is the same as in the liquid state. In contrast, during the formation of the VD MGs, the absence of the liquid state results in the creation of a different chemical order with more Zr-Zr homonuclear bonds compared with the melt-quenched MGs. In order to obtain MGs from melt-quench technique with similarly low energies as in the VD process, the cooling rate during quenching would have to be many orders of magnitude lower than currently accessible to MD simulations. The method proposed in this manuscript is a more efficient way to create MGs by using MD simulations.</summary>

    <summary>A thermomechanical model of continuous fluid media based on second gradient theory is used to study motions in liquid-vapor interfaces. At equilibrium, the model is shown to be equivalent to mean-field molecular theories of capillarity. In such fluids, conservative motions verify first integrals that lead to Kelvin circulation theorems and potential equations. The dynamical surface tension of liquid-vapor interfaces is deduced from viscous fluid equations. The result provides and explains the Marangoni effect.</summary>

    <summary>We carry out a series of experiments with a special interest on growing and condensing processes of vapor bubble(s) injected into a subcooled pool. We examine effects of the degree of subcooling of the bulk in the pool and injection rate of the vapor into the pool. We pay their special attention to (i) abrupt collapse of the injected vapor bubble to form micrometer-scale bubbles, and (ii) interaction of adjacent vapor bubbles laterally injected to the pool through the orifices. We have found that a fine disturbance does arise on the surface of the vapor bubble just prior to its abrupt collapse. The bubble never exhibits an abrupt collapse without such instability over the free surface. In the case of the injection of a pair of vapor bubbles through the neighboring orifices, the interaction between the bubbles and the effects of the induced flows by the bubble behaviors control the surface dynamics. This fluid dynamics video introduces those phenomena.</summary>

    <title>Interfacial instability induced by lateral vapor pressure fluctuation in bounded thin liquid-vapor layers</title>
    <updated>2009-07-30T09:16:20Z</updated>

    <summary>  We study an instability of thin liquid-vapor layers bounded by rigid parallel walls from both below and above. In this system, the interfacial instability is induced by lateral vapor pressure fluctuation, which is in turn attributed to the effect of phase change: evaporation occurs at a hotter portion of the interface and condensation at a colder one. The high vapor pressure pushes the interface downward and the low one pulls it upward. A set of equations describing the temporal evolution of the interface of the liquid-vapor layers is derived. This model neglects the effect of mass loss or gain at the interface and guarantees the mass conservation of the liquid layer. The result of linear stability analysis of the model shows that the presence of the pressure dependence of the local saturation temperature mitigates the growth of long-wave disturbances. The thinner vapor layer enhances the vapor pressure effect. We find the stability criterion, which suggests that only slight temperature gradients are sufficient to overcome the gravitational effect for a water/vapor system. The same holds for the Rayleigh-Taylor unstable case, with a possibility that the vapor pressure effect may be weakened if the accommodation coefficient is below a certain critical value.</summary>
