    <summary>In the compressive phase retrieval problem, or phaseless compressed sensing, or compressed sensing from intensity only measurements, the goal is to reconstruct a sparse or approximately $k$-sparse vector $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ given access to $y= |Φx|$, where $|v|$ denotes the vector obtained from taking the absolute value of $v\in\mathbb{R}^n$ coordinate-wise. In this paper we present sublinear-time algorithms for different variants of the compressive phase retrieval problem which are akin to the variants considered for the classical compressive sensing problem in theoretical computer science. Our algorithms use pure combinatorial techniques and near-optimal number of measurements.</summary>

    <summary>Hyperspectral Imaging comprises excessive data consequently leading to significant challenges for data processing, storage and transmission. Compressive Sensing has been used in the field of Hyperspectral Imaging as a technique to compress the large amount of data. This work addresses the recovery of hyperspectral images 2.5x compressed. A comparative study in terms of the accuracy and the performance of the convex FISTA/ADMM in addition to the greedy gOMP/BIHT/CoSaMP recovery algorithms is presented. The results indicate that the algorithms recover successfully the compressed data, yet the gOMP algorithm achieves superior accuracy and faster recovery in comparison to the other algorithms at the expense of high dependence on unknown sparsity level of the data to recover.</summary>

    <summary>  We survey a new paradigm in signal processing known as "compressive sensing". Contrary to old practices of data acquisition and reconstruction based on the Shannon-Nyquist sampling principle, the new theory shows that it is possible to reconstruct images or signals of scientific interest accurately and even exactly from a number of samples which is far smaller than the desired resolution of the image/signal, e.g., the number of pixels in the image. This new technique draws from results in several fields of mathematics, including algebra, optimization, probability theory, and harmonic analysis. We will discuss some of the key mathematical ideas behind compressive sensing, as well as its implications to other fields: numerical analysis, information theory, theoretical computer science, and engineering.</summary>

    <summary>We describe a general framework -- compressive statistical learning -- for resource-efficient large-scale learning: the training collection is compressed in one pass into a low-dimensional sketch (a vector of random empirical generalized moments) that captures the information relevant to the considered learning task. A near-minimizer of the risk is computed from the sketch through the solution of a nonlinear least squares problem. We investigate sufficient sketch sizes to control the generalization error of this procedure. The framework is illustrated on compressive PCA, compressive clustering, and compressive Gaussian mixture Modeling with fixed known variance. The latter two are further developed in a companion paper.</summary>

    <title>Study of the gOMP Algorithm for Recovery of Compressed Sensed Hyperspectral Images</title>

    <summary>Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) is used in a wide range of applications such as remote sensing, yet the transmission of the HS images by communication data links becomes challenging due to the large number of spectral bands that the HS images contain together with the limited data bandwidth available in real applications. Compressive Sensing reduces the images by randomly subsampling the spectral bands of each spatial pixel and then it performs the image reconstruction of all the bands using recovery algorithms which impose sparsity in a certain transform domain. Since the image pixels are not strictly sparse, this work studies a data sparsification pre-processing stage prior to compression to ensure the sparsity of the pixels. The sparsified images are compressed $2.5\times$ and then recovered using the Generalized Orthogonal Matching Pursuit algorithm (gOMP) characterized by high accuracy, low computational requirements and fast convergence. The experiments are performed in five conventional hyperspectral images where the effect of different sparsification levels in the quality of the uncompressed as well as the recovered images is studied. It is concluded that the gOMP algorithm reconstructs the hyperspectral images with higher accuracy as well as faster convergence when the pixels are highly sparsified and hence at the expense of reducing the quality of the recovered images with respect to the original images.</summary>
