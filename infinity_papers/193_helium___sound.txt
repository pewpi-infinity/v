    <summary>Humans have a privileged, embodied way to explore the world of sounds, through vocal imitation. The Quantum Vocal Theory of Sounds (QVTS) starts from the assumption that any sound can be expressed and described as the evolution of a superposition of vocal states, i.e., phonation, turbulence, and supraglottal myoelastic vibrations. The postulates of quantum mechanics, with the notions of observable, measurement, and time evolution of state, provide a model that can be used for sound processing, in both directions of analysis and synthesis. QVTS can give a quantum-theoretic explanation to some auditory streaming phenomena, eventually leading to practical solutions of relevant sound-processing problems, or it can be creatively exploited to manipulate superpositions of sonic elements. Perhaps more importantly, QVTS may be a fertile ground to host a dialogue between physicists, computer scientists, musicians, and sound designers, possibly giving us unheard manifestations of human creativity.</summary>

    <summary>Audio-visual navigation task requires an agent to find a sound source in a realistic, unmapped 3D environment by utilizing egocentric audio-visual observations. Existing audio-visual navigation works assume a clean environment that solely contains the target sound, which, however, would not be suitable in most real-world applications due to the unexpected sound noise or intentional interference. In this work, we design an acoustically complex environment in which, besides the target sound, there exists a sound attacker playing a zero-sum game with the agent. More specifically, the attacker can move and change the volume and category of the sound to make the agent suffer from finding the sounding object while the agent tries to dodge the attack and navigate to the goal under the intervention. Under certain constraints to the attacker, we can improve the robustness of the agent towards unexpected sound attacks in audio-visual navigation. For better convergence, we develop a joint training mechanism by employing the property of a centralized critic with decentralized actors. Experiments on two real-world 3D scan datasets, Replica, and Matterport3D, verify the effectiveness and the robustness of the agent trained under our designed environment when transferred to the clean environment or the one containing sound attackers with random policy.

    <summary>Spectrograms are 2D representations of sound that look very different from the images found in our visual world. And natural images, when played as spectrograms, make unnatural sounds. In this paper, we show that it is possible to synthesize spectrograms that simultaneously look like natural images and sound like natural audio. We call these visual spectrograms images that sound. Our approach is simple and zero-shot, and it leverages pre-trained text-to-image and text-to-spectrogram diffusion models that operate in a shared latent space. During the reverse process, we denoise noisy latents with both the audio and image diffusion models in parallel, resulting in a sample that is likely under both models. Through quantitative evaluations and perceptual studies, we find that our method successfully generates spectrograms that align with a desired audio prompt while also taking the visual appearance of a desired image prompt.

    <title>Numerical simulation of sound propagation in and around ducts using thin boundary elements</title>
    <updated>2022-03-08T08:45:40Z</updated>

    <summary>Investigating the sound field in and around ducts is an important topic in acoustics, e.g. when simulating musical instruments or the human vocal tract. In this paper a method that is based on the boundary element method in 3D combined with a formulation for infinitely thin elements is presented. The boundary integral equations for these elements are presented, and numerical experiments are used to illustrate the behavior of the thin elements. Using the example of a closed benchmark duct, boundary element solutions for thin elements and surface elements are compared with the analytic solution, and the accuracy of the boundary element method as function of element size is investigated. As already shown for surface elements in the literature, an accumulation of the error along the duct can also be found for thin elements, but in contrast to surface elements this effect is not as big and a damping of the amplitude cannot be seen. In a second experiment, the impedance at the open end of a half open duct is compared with formulas for the radiation impedance of an unflanged tube, and a good agreement is shown. Finally, resonance frequencies of a tube open at both ends are calculated and compared with measured spectra. For sufficiently small element sizes frequencies for lower harmonics agree very well, for higher frequencies a difference of a few Hertz can be observed, which may be explained by the fact that the method does not consider dampening effects near the duct walls. The numerical experiments also suggest, that for duct simulations the usual six to eight elements per wavelength rule is not enough for accurate results.</summary>

    <title>Sound field reconstruction in rooms: inpainting meets super-resolution</title>
    <updated>2020-08-06T16:14:24Z</updated>

    <summary>In this paper, a deep-learning-based method for sound field reconstruction is proposed. It is shown the possibility to reconstruct the magnitude of the sound pressure in the frequency band 30-300 Hz for an entire room by using a very low number of irregularly distributed microphones arbitrarily arranged. Moreover, the approach is agnostic to the location of the measurements in the Euclidean space. In particular, the presented approach uses a limited number of arbitrary discrete measurements of the magnitude of the sound field pressure in order to extrapolate this field to a higher-resolution grid of discrete points in space with a low computational complexity. The method is based on a U-net-like neural network with partial convolutions trained solely on simulated data, which itself is constructed from numerical simulations of Green's function across thousands of common rectangular rooms. Although extensible to three dimensions and different room shapes, the method focuses on reconstructing a two-dimensional plane of a rectangular room from measurements of the three-dimensional sound field. Experiments using simulated data together with an experimental validation in a real listening room are shown. The results suggest a performance which may exceed conventional reconstruction techniques for a low number of microphones and computational requirements.</summary>
