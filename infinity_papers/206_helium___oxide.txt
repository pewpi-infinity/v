    <summary>Oxide materials exhibit several novel structural, magnetic, and electronic properties. Their stability under ambient conditions, easy synthesis, and high transition temperatures provide such systems with an ideal ground for realizing topological properties and real-life technological applications. However, experimental evidence of topological states in oxide materials is rare. In this study, we have synthesized single crystals of oxide double perovskite Sr2FeMoO6 and revealed its topological nature by investigating its structural, magnetic, and electronic properties. We observed that the system crystallized in the cubic space group Fm-3m, which is a half-metallic ferromagnet. Transport measurements show an anomalous Hall effect, and it is evident that the Hall contribution originates from the Berry curvature. Assuming a shift of the Fermi energy towards the conduction band, the contribution of the anomalous Hall effect is enhanced owing to the presence of a gaped nodal line. This study can be used to explore and realize the topological properties of bulk oxide systems.</summary>

    <title>A first-principles study of helium storage in oxides and at oxide--iron interfaces</title>

    <summary>Density-functional theory calculations based on conventional as well as hybrid exchange-correlation functionals have been carried out to study the properties of helium in various oxides (Al2O3, TiO2, Y2O3, YAP, YAG, YAM, MgO, CaO, BaO, SrO) as well as at oxide-iron interfaces. Helium interstitials in bulk oxides are shown to be energetically more favorable than substitutional helium, yet helium binds to existing vacancies. The solubility of He in oxides is systematically higher than in iron and scales with the free volume at the interstitial site nearly independently of the chemical composition of the oxide. In most oxides He migration is significantly slower and He--He binding is much weaker than in iron. To quantify the solubility of helium at oxide-iron interfaces two prototypical systems are considered (Fe|MgO, Fe|FeO|MgO). In both cases the He solubility is markedly enhanced in the interface compared to either of the bulk phases. The results of the calculations allow to construct a schematic energy landscape for He interstitials in iron. The implications of these results are discussed in the context of helium sequestration in oxide dispersion strengthened steels, including the effects of interfaces and lattice strain.</summary>

    <summary>  Liquid helium is crucial to conveniently vary magnetic field (H) and temperature (T) giving access to a large region of (H, T) space; in stark contrast with the effort currently required to explore a comparable region of (P, T) space. The centenary of the liquefaction of helium is an appropriate occasion to talk on the utilization of our facilities for studies across first order phase transitions. We observed some interesting effects in variety of systems traversing (H, T) space across the magnetic first order phase transitions. We focus here on a few recent intriguing discoveries in the half-doped manganites related to the coexistence of equilibrium phase, with a glass-like phase having both structural and magnetic long-range order.</summary>

    <title>Molecular mechanism of water permeation in helium impermeable graphene and graphene oxide membrane</title>
    <updated>2015-09-29T10:53:29Z</updated>

    <summary>The layers of graphene oxide (GO) are found to be good for permeation of water but not for helium (Science 2012 335 (6067): 442-444) suggesting that the GO layers are dynamic in the formation of permeation route depending on the environment they are in (i.e, water or helium). To probe the microscopic origin of this observation we calculate the potential of mean force (PMF) of GO sheets (oxidized and reduced parts), with inter-planar distance as reaction coordinate in helium and water. Our PMF calculation shows that equilibrium interlayer distance between oxidized part of GO sheets in helium is at 4.8 Å leaving no space for helium permeation. In contrast PMF of oxidized part of GO in water shows two minima one at 4.8 Å and another at 6.8 Å corresponding to no water and water filled region and thus giving rise to permeation path. The increased electrostatic interaction between water with the oxidized part of the sheet helps the sheet opening up and pushing water inside. Based on the entropy calculations for water trapped between graphene sheets and oxidized graphene sheets at different inter-sheet spacing we also show the thermodynamics of filling.</summary>
