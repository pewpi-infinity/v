    <summary>Wavelet analysis and compression tools are reviewed and different applications to study MHD and plasma turbulence are presented. We introduce the continuous and the orthogonal wavelet transform and detail several statistical diagnostics based on the wavelet coefficients. We then show how to extract coherent structures out of fully developed turbulent flows using wavelet-based denoising. Finally some multiscale numerical simulation schemes using wavelets are described. Several examples for analyzing, compressing and computing one, two and three dimensional turbulent MHD or plasma flows are presented.</summary>

    <title>Attosecond dispersion as a diagnostics tool for solid-density laser-generated plasmas</title>

    <summary>Extreme-ultraviolet pulses can propagate through ionised solid-density targets, unlike optical pulses and, thus, have the potential to probe the interior of such plasmas on sub-femtosecond timescales. We present a synthetic diagnostic method for solid-density laser-generated plasmas based on the dispersion of an extreme-ultraviolet attosecond probe pulse, in a pump--probe scheme. We demonstrate the theoretical feasibility of this approach through calculating the dispersion of an extreme-ultraviolet probe pulse propagating through a laser-generated plasma. The plasma dynamics is calculated using a particle-in-cell simulation, whereas the dispersion of the probe is calculated with an external pseudo-spectral wave solver, allowing for high accuracy when calculating the dispersion. The application of this method is illustrated on thin-film plastic and aluminium targets irradiated by a high-intensity pump pulse. By comparing the dispersion of the probe pulse at different delays relative to the pump pulse, it is possible to follow the evolution of the plasma as it disintegrates. The high-frequency end of the dispersion provides information on the line-integrated electron density, whereas lower frequencies are more affected by the highest density encountered along the path of the probe. In addition, the presence of thin-film interference could be used to study the evolution of the plasma surface.</summary>

    <title>Sub-grid-scale effects in magnetised plasma turbulence</title>

    <summary>In the present paper, we use a coarse-graining approach to investigate the nonlinear redistribution of free energy in both position and scale space for weakly collisional magnetised plasma turbulence. For this purpose, we use high-resolution numerical simulations of gyrokinetic (GK) turbulence that span the proton-electron range of scales, in a straight magnetic guide field geometry. Accounting for the averaged effect of the particles' fast gyro-motion on the slow plasma fluctuations, the GK approximation captures the dominant energy redistribution mechanisms in strongly magnetised plasma turbulence. Here, the GK system is coarse-grained with respect to a cut-off scale, separating in real space the contributions to the nonlinear interactions from the coarse-grid-scales and the sub-grid-scales (SGS). We concentrate on the analysis of nonlinear SGS effects. Not only that this allows us to investigate the flux of free energy across the scales, but also to now analyse its spatial density. We find that the net value of scale flux is an order of magnitude smaller than both the positive and negative flux density contributions. The dependence of the results on the filter type is also analysed. Moreover, we investigate the advection of energy in position space. This rather novel approach for GK turbulence can help in the development of SGS models that account for advective unstable structures for space and fusion plasmas, and with the analysis of the turbulent transport saturation.</summary>

    <summary>The effect of changes in plasma parameters, that are characteristic near or at an L-H transition in fusion edge plasmas, on fluctuation correlation lengths are analysed by means of drift-Alfven turbulence computations. Scalings by density gradient length, collisionality, plasma beta, and by an imposed shear flow are considered. It is found that strongly sheared flows lead to the appearence of long-range correlations in electrostatic potential fluctuations parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field.</summary>

    <summary>The highly advanced treatment of surfaces as etching and deposition is mainly enabled by the extraordinary properties of technological plasmas. The primary factors that influence these processes are the flux and the energy of various species, particularly ions, that impinge the substrate surface. These features can be theoretically described using the ion energy distribution function (IEDF). The article is intended to summarize the fundamental concepts of modeling and simulation of IEDFs from simplified models to self-consistent plasma simulations. Finally, concepts for controlling the IEDF are discussed.</summary>
