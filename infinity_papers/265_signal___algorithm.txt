    <summary>Time-vertex graph signal (TVGS) models describe time-varying data with irregular structures. The bandlimitedness in the joint time-vertex Fourier spectral domain reflects smoothness in both temporal and graph topology. In this paper, we study the critical sampling of three types of TVGS including continuous-time signals, infinite-length sequences, and finite-length sequences in the time domain for each vertex on the graph. For a jointly bandlimited TVGS, we prove a lower bound on sampling density or sampling ratio, which depends on the measure of the spectral support in the joint time-vertex Fourier spectral domain. We also provide a lower bound on the sampling density or sampling ratio of each vertex on sampling sets for perfect recovery. To demonstrate that critical sampling is achievable, we propose the sampling and reconstruction procedures for the different types of TVGS. Finally, we show how the proposed sampling schemes can be applied to numerical as well as real datasets.</summary>

    <title>Recovery Conditions of Sparse Signals Using Orthogonal Least Squares-Type Algorithms</title>

    <summary>Orthogonal least squares (OLS)-type algorithms are efficient in reconstructing sparse signals, which include the well-known OLS, multiple OLS (MOLS) and block OLS (BOLS). In this paper, we first investigate the noiseless exact recovery conditions of these algorithms. Specifically, based on mutual incoherence property (MIP), we provide theoretical analysis of OLS and MOLS to ensure that the correct nonzero support can be selected during the iterative procedure. Nevertheless, theoretical analysis for BOLS utilizes the block-MIP to deal with the block sparsity. Furthermore, the noiseless MIP-based analyses are extended to the noisy scenario. Our results indicate that for K-sparse signals, when MIP or SNR satisfies certain conditions, OLS and MOLS obtain reliable reconstruction in at most K iterations, while BOLS succeeds in at most (K/d) iterations where d is the block length. It is shown that our derived theoretical results improve the existing ones, which are verified by simulation tests.</summary>

    <summary>Advances in machine learning technology have enabled real-time extraction of semantic information in signals which can revolutionize signal processing techniques and improve their performance significantly for the next generation of applications. With the objective of a concrete representation and efficient processing of the semantic information, we propose and demonstrate a formal graph-based semantic language and a goal filtering method that enables goal-oriented signal processing. The proposed semantic signal processing framework can easily be tailored for specific applications and goals in a diverse range of signal processing applications. To illustrate its wide range of applicability, we investigate several use cases and provide details on how the proposed goal-oriented semantic signal processing framework can be customized. We also investigate and propose techniques for communications where sensor data is semantically processed and semantic information is exchanged across a sensor network.</summary>

    <title>Defining Fundamental Frequency for Almost Harmonic Signals</title>
    <updated>2020-10-30T11:44:23Z</updated>

    <summary>In this work, we consider the modeling of signals that are almost, but not quite, harmonic, i.e., composed of sinusoids whose frequencies are close to being integer multiples of a common frequency. Typically, in applications, such signals are treated as perfectly harmonic, allowing for the estimation of their fundamental frequency, despite the signals not actually being periodic. Herein, we provide three different definitions of a concept of fundamental frequency for such inharmonic signals and study the implications of the different choices for modeling and estimation. We show that one of the definitions corresponds to a misspecified modeling scenario, and provides a theoretical benchmark for analyzing the behavior of estimators derived under a perfectly harmonic assumption. The second definition stems from optimal mass transport theory and yields a robust and easily interpretable concept of fundamental frequency based on the signals' spectral properties. The third definition interprets the inharmonic signal as an observation of a randomly perturbed harmonic signal. This allows for computing a hybrid information theoretical bound on estimation performance, as well as for finding an estimator attaining the bound. The theoretical findings are illustrated using numerical examples.</summary>

    <title>Min-Max Framework for Majorization-Minimization Algorithms in Signal Processing Applications: An Overview</title>

    <summary>This monograph presents a theoretical background and a broad introduction to the Min-Max Framework for Majorization-Minimization (MM4MM), an algorithmic methodology for solving minimization problems by formulating them as min-max problems and then employing majorization-minimization. The monograph lays out the mathematical basis of the approach used to reformulate a minimization problem as a min-max problem. With the prerequisites covered, including multiple illustrations of the formulations for convex and non-convex functions, this work serves as a guide for developing MM4MM-based algorithms for solving non-convex optimization problems in various areas of signal processing. As special cases, we discuss using the majorization-minimization technique to solve min-max problems encountered in signal processing applications and min-max problems formulated using the Lagrangian. Lastly, we present detailed examples of using MM4MM in ten signal processing applications such as phase retrieval, source localization, independent vector analysis, beamforming and optimal sensor placement in wireless sensor networks. The devised MM4MM algorithms are free of hyper-parameters and enjoy the advantages inherited from the use of the majorization-minimization technique such as monotonicity.</summary>
