    <summary>The local theory of complex dimensions describes the oscillations in the geometry (spectra and dynamics) of fractal strings. Such geometric oscillations can be seen most clearly in the explicit volume formula for the tubular neighborhoods of a $p$-adic fractal string $\mathcal{L}_p$, expressed in terms of the underlying complex dimensions. The general fractal tube formula obtained in this paper is illustrated by several examples, including the nonarchimedean Cantor and Euler strings. Moreover, we show that the Minkowski dimension of a $p$-adic fractal string coincides with the abscissa of convergence of the geometric zeta function associated with the string, as well as with the asymptotic growth rate of the corresponding geometric counting function. The proof of this new result can be applied to both real and $p$-adic fractal strings and hence, yields a unifying explanation of a key result in the theory of complex dimensions for fractal strings, even in the archimedean (or real) case.</summary>

    <summary>The chemical composition of a planetary body reflects its starting conditions modified by numerous processes during its formation and geological evolution. Measurements by X-ray, gamma-ray, and neutron spectrometers on the MESSENGER spacecraft revealed Mercury's surface to have surprisingly high abundances of the moderately volatile elements sodium, sulfur, potassium, chlorine, and thorium, and a low abundance of iron. This composition rules out some formation models for which high temperatures are expected to have strongly depleted volatiles and indicates that Mercury formed under conditions much more reducing than the other rocky planets of our Solar System. Through geochemical modeling and petrologic experiments, the planet's mantle and core compositions can be estimated from the surface composition and geophysical constraints. The bulk silicate composition of Mercury is likely similar to that of enstatite or metal-rich chondrite meteorites, and the planet's unusually large core is most likely Si rich, implying that in bulk Mercury is enriched in Fe and Si (and possibly S) relative to the other inner planets. The compositional data for Mercury acquired by MESSENGER will be crucial for quantitatively testing future models of the formation of Mercury and the Solar System as a whole, as well as for constraining the geological evolution of the innermost planet.</summary>

    <summary>We describe the current state of knowledge about Mercury's interior structure. We review the available observational constraints, including mass, size, density, gravity field, spin state, composition, and tidal response. These data enable the construction of models that represent the distribution of mass inside Mercury. In particular, we infer radial profiles of the pressure, density, and gravity in the core, mantle, and crust. We also examine Mercury's rotational dynamics and the influence of an inner core on the spin state and the determination of the moment of inertia. Finally, we discuss the wide-ranging implications of Mercury's internal structure on its thermal evolution, surface geology, capture in a unique spin-orbit resonance, and magnetic field generation.</summary>

    <summary>The MESSENGER mission sought to discover what physical processes determined Mercury's high metal to silicate ratio. Instead, the mission has discovered multiple anomalous characteristics about our innermost planet. The lack of FeO and the reduced oxidation state of Mercury's crust and mantle are more extreme than nearly all other known materials in the solar system. In contrast, moderately volatile elements are present in abundances comparable to the other terrestrial planets. No single process during Mercury's formation is able to explain all of these observations. Here, we review the current ideas for the origin of Mercury's unique features. Gaps in understanding the innermost regions of the solar nebula limit testing different hypotheses. Even so, all proposed models are incomplete and need further development in order to unravel Mercury's remaining secrets.</summary>
