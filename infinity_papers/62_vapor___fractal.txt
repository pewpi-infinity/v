    <summary>The local theory of complex dimensions describes the oscillations in the geometry (spectra and dynamics) of fractal strings. Such geometric oscillations can be seen most clearly in the explicit volume formula for the tubular neighborhoods of a $p$-adic fractal string $\mathcal{L}_p$, expressed in terms of the underlying complex dimensions. The general fractal tube formula obtained in this paper is illustrated by several examples, including the nonarchimedean Cantor and Euler strings. Moreover, we show that the Minkowski dimension of a $p$-adic fractal string coincides with the abscissa of convergence of the geometric zeta function associated with the string, as well as with the asymptotic growth rate of the corresponding geometric counting function. The proof of this new result can be applied to both real and $p$-adic fractal strings and hence, yields a unifying explanation of a key result in the theory of complex dimensions for fractal strings, even in the archimedean (or real) case.</summary>

    <summary>The functional features of spatial networks depend upon a non-trivial relationship between the topological and physical structure. Here, we explore that relationship for spatial networks with radial symmetry and disordered fractal morphology. Under a geometric graphs approach, we quantify the effectiveness of the exchange of information in the system from center to perimeter and over the entire network structure. We mainly consider two paradigmatic models of disordered fractal formation, the Ballistic Aggregation and Diffusion-Limited Aggregation models, and complementary, the Viscek and Hexaflake fractals, and Kagome and Hexagonal lattices. First, we show that complex tree morphologies provide important advantages over regular configurations, such as an invariant structural cost for different fractal dimensions. Furthermore, although these systems are known to be scale-free in space, they have bounded degree distributions for different values of an euclidean connectivity parameter and, therefore, do not represent ordinary scale-free networks. Finally, compared to regular structures, fractal trees are fragile and overall inefficient as expected, however, we show that this efficiency can become similar to that of a robust hexagonal lattice, at a similar cost, by just considering a very short euclidean connectivity beyond first neighbors.</summary>

    <summary>Fractals have been at the heart of geophysical and geospatial studies in the recent past. We examine the emergent fractal character of water vapor distributions above the surface of the Earth as a function of both image resolution (number of pixels) and moisture content percentile. We calculate physically relevant quantities such as fractal dimension, number of clusters, and size of the largest cluster with varying vapor percentile using computational methods and algorithms. Our analysis unravels a potential multi-fractal character of the data which we construct using the box-counting method to calculate the generalized dimension. We examine the nature of the percolation that occurs as the vapor percentile is varied and comment on the universality class of the transition. We test the applicability of Korcak's law on our system and determine the quality of the fit using the Kolmogorov-Smirnoff statistic. We show that the fractal character of the distribution is exact as a function of image resolution and approximate in some regimes as a function of the vapor percentiles.</summary>

    <summary>Bacteria light harvesters are interpreted as Vicsek fractal, based upon their morphology, even though such fractals contain only one, or perhaps two, generations. After using fractal dimensions to describe the geometry, we progress to use connectivity matrices to make an improved description of the light harvesters and make connections with our previous studies.</summary>

    <title>Fractal Tube Formulas for Compact Sets and Relative Fractal Drums: Oscillations, Complex Dimensions and Fractality</title>
    <updated>2018-03-20T10:38:43Z</updated>

    <summary>We establish pointwise and distributional fractal tube formulas for a large class of relative fractal drums in Euclidean spaces of arbitrary dimensions. A relative fractal drum (or RFD, in short) is an ordered pair $(A,Ω)$ of subsets of the Euclidean space (under some mild assumptions) which generalizes the notion of a (compact) subset and that of a fractal string. By a fractal tube formula for an RFD $(A,Ω)$, we mean an explicit expression for the volume of the $t$-neighborhood of $A$ intersected by $Ω$ as a sum of residues of a suitable meromorphic function (here, a fractal zeta function) over the complex dimensions of the RFD $(A,Ω)$. The complex dimensions of an RFD are defined as the poles of its meromorphically continued fractal zeta function (namely, the distance or the tube zeta function), which generalizes the well-known geometric zeta function for fractal strings. These fractal tube formulas generalize in a significant way to higher dimensions the corresponding ones previously obtained for fractal strings by the first author and van Frankenhuijsen and later on, by the first author, Pearse and Winter in the case of fractal sprays. They are illustrated by several interesting examples. These examples include fractal strings, the Sierpiński gasket and the 3-dimensional carpet, fractal nests and geometric chirps, as well as self-similar fractal sprays. We also propose a new definition of fractality according to which a bounded set (or RFD) is considered to be fractal if it possesses at least one nonreal complex dimension or if its fractal zeta function possesses a natural boundary. This definition, which extends to RFDs and arbitrary bounded subsets of $\mathbb{R}^N$ the previous one introduced in the context of fractal strings, is illustrated by the Cantor graph (or devil's staircase) RFD, which is shown to be `subcritically fractal'.</summary>
