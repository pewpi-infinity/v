ABSTRACT:
This research paper explores the topic 'sound & plasma', synthesizing results from
high-tier scientific repositories including Semantic Scholar and arXiv.
The inquiry focuses on establishing cross-domain relationships and 
Infinity-OS-level technical interpretations.

SECTION 1 — Conceptual Framework
The subject 'sound & plasma' is examined using principles from quantum decision modeling,
oxide-layer microelectronics, hydrogen-doorway event physics, and generative

    <summary>A one-dimensional model for thinning of the Earth's plasma sheet [J. K. Chao et al., Planet. Space Sci. 25, 703 (1977)] according to the Current Disruption (CD) model of auroral breakup is extended to two dimensions. A rarefaction wave, which is a signature component of the CD model, is generated with an initial disturbance. In the 1D gas model, the rarefaction wave propagates tailward at sound velocity and is assumed to cause thinning. Extending to a 2D gas model of a simplified plasma sheet configuration, the rarefaction wave is weakened, and the thinning ceases to propagate. Extending further to a 2D plasma model by adding magnetic field into the lobes, the rarefaction wave is quickly lost in the plasma sheet recompression, but the plasma sheet thinning is still present and propagates independently at a slower velocity than a 1D model suggests. This shows that the dynamics of plasma sheet thinning may be dominated by sheet-lobe interactions that are absent from the 1D model and may not support the behaviour assumed by the CD model.</summary>

    <summary>Wavelet analysis and compression tools are reviewed and different applications to study MHD and plasma turbulence are presented. We introduce the continuous and the orthogonal wavelet transform and detail several statistical diagnostics based on the wavelet coefficients. We then show how to extract coherent structures out of fully developed turbulent flows using wavelet-based denoising. Finally some multiscale numerical simulation schemes using wavelets are described. Several examples for analyzing, compressing and computing one, two and three dimensional turbulent MHD or plasma flows are presented.</summary>

    <title>Attosecond dispersion as a diagnostics tool for solid-density laser-generated plasmas</title>

    <summary>Extreme-ultraviolet pulses can propagate through ionised solid-density targets, unlike optical pulses and, thus, have the potential to probe the interior of such plasmas on sub-femtosecond timescales. We present a synthetic diagnostic method for solid-density laser-generated plasmas based on the dispersion of an extreme-ultraviolet attosecond probe pulse, in a pump--probe scheme. We demonstrate the theoretical feasibility of this approach through calculating the dispersion of an extreme-ultraviolet probe pulse propagating through a laser-generated plasma. The plasma dynamics is calculated using a particle-in-cell simulation, whereas the dispersion of the probe is calculated with an external pseudo-spectral wave solver, allowing for high accuracy when calculating the dispersion. The application of this method is illustrated on thin-film plastic and aluminium targets irradiated by a high-intensity pump pulse. By comparing the dispersion of the probe pulse at different delays relative to the pump pulse, it is possible to follow the evolution of the plasma as it disintegrates. The high-frequency end of the dispersion provides information on the line-integrated electron density, whereas lower frequencies are more affected by the highest density encountered along the path of the probe. In addition, the presence of thin-film interference could be used to study the evolution of the plasma surface.</summary>

    <summary>The effect of changes in plasma parameters, that are characteristic near or at an L-H transition in fusion edge plasmas, on fluctuation correlation lengths are analysed by means of drift-Alfven turbulence computations. Scalings by density gradient length, collisionality, plasma beta, and by an imposed shear flow are considered. It is found that strongly sheared flows lead to the appearence of long-range correlations in electrostatic potential fluctuations parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field.</summary>

    <title>Ion drift instability in a strongly coupled collisional complex plasma</title>
    <updated>2020-07-27T18:45:56Z</updated>

    <summary>We investigate the low-frequency wave mode associated with heavy particles and its instability in a collisional complex plasma with drifting ions. The effect of the ion drift on the sound velocity of this mode is discussed. The general condition of the instability is derived for subthermal ion drifts, taking into account strong coupling of the particle component. As a general tendency, strong coupling effects reduce the sound velocity and facilitate the occurrence of the ion drift instability. A wide parameter range is considered from the weakly collisional to strongly collisional regimes for the ion and particle components. The chosen plasma parameters are representative to the PK-4 experiment, currently operational on board the International Space Station.</summary>
