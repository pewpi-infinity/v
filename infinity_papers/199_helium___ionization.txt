    <summary>We present measurements of the singly ionized helium to hydrogen ratio ($n_{He^+}/n_{H^+}$) toward diffuse gas surrounding three Ultra-Compact HII (UCHII ) regions: G10.15-0.34, G23.46-0.20 \&amp; G29.96-0.02. We observe radio recombination lines (RRLs) of hydrogen and helium near 5 GHz using the GBT to measure the $n_{He^+}/n_{H^+}$ ratio. The measurements are motivated by the low helium ionization observed in the warm ionized medium (WIM) and in the inner Galaxy diffuse ionized regions (DIR). Our data indicate that the helium is not uniformly ionized in the three observed sources. Helium lines are not detected toward a few observed positions in sources G10.15-0.34 \&amp; G23.46-0.20 and the upper limits of the $n_{He^+}/n_{H^+}$ ratio obtained are 0.03 and 0.05 respectively. The selected sources harbor stars of type O6 or hotter as indicated by helium line detection toward the bright radio continuum emission from the sources with mean $n_{He^+}/n_{H^+}$ value 0.06$\pm$0.02. Our data thus show that helium in diffuse gas located a few pc away from the young massive stars embedded in the observed regions is not fully ionized.We investigate the origin of the non-uniform helium ionization and rule out the possibilities : (a) that the helium is doubly ionized in the observed regions and (b) that the low $n_{He^+}/n_{H^+}$ values are due to additional hydrogen ionizing radiation produced by accreting low-mass stars (Smith 2014). We find that selective absorption of ionizing photons by dust can result in low helium ionization but needs further investigation to develop a self-consistent model for dust in HII regions.</summary>

    <summary>  We investigate the influence of the ionization of helium on the low-degree acoustic oscillation frequencies in model solar-type stars. The signature in the oscillation frequencies characterizing the ionization-induced depression of the first adiabatic exponent $γ$ is a superposition of two decaying periodic functions of frequency $ν$, with `frequencies' that are approximately twice the acoustic depths of the centres of the Helium I and Helium II ionization regions. That variation is probably best exhibited in the second frequency difference $Δ_2ν_{n,l}\equivν_{n-1,l}-2ν{n,l}+ν_{n+1,l}$. We show how an analytic approximation to the variation of $γ$ leads to a simple representation of this oscillatory contribution to $Δ_2ν$ which can be used to characterize the $γ$ variation, our intention being to use it as a seismic diagnostic of the helium abundance of the star. We emphasize that the objective is to characterize $γ$, not merely to find a formula for $Δ_2ν$ that reproduces the data.</summary>

    <title>Non-equilibrium helium ionization in an MHD simulation of the solar atmosphere</title>

    <summary>The ionization state of the gas in the dynamic solar chromosphere can depart strongly from the instantaneous statistical equilibrium commonly assumed in numerical modeling. We improve on earlier simulations of the solar atmosphere that only included non-equilbrium hydrogen ionization by performing a 2D radiation-magneto-hydrodynamics simulation featuring non-equilibrium ionization of both hydrogen and helium. The simulation includes the effect of hydrogen Lyman-$α$ and the EUV radiation from the corona on the ionization and heating of the atmosphere. Details on code implementation are given. We obtain helium ion fractions that are far from their equilibrium values. Comparison with models with LTE ionization shows that non-equilibrium helium ionization leads to higher temperatures in wave fronts and lower temperatures in the gas between shocks. Assuming LTE ionization results in a thermostat-like behaviour with matter accumulating around the temperatures where the LTE ionization fractions change rapidly. Comparison of DEM curves computed from our models shows that non-equilibrium ionization leads to more radiating material in the temperature range 11-18 kK compared to models with LTE helium ionization. We conclude that non-equilbrium helium ionization is important for the dynamics and thermal structure of the upper chromosphere and transition region. It might also help resolve the problem that intensities of chromospheric lines computed from current models are smaller than those observed.</summary>

    <summary>Helium ionization plays an important role in the energy balance of the upper chromosphere and transition region. Helium spectral lines are also often used as diagnostics of these regions. We carry out 1D radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of the solar atmosphere and find that the helium ionization is mostly set by photoionization and direct collisional ionization, counteracted by radiative recombination cascades. By introducing an additional recombination rate mimicking the recombination cascades, we construct a simplified 3 level helium model atom consisting of only the ground states. This model atom is suitable for modeling non-equilibrium helium ionization in 3D numerical models. We perform a brief investigation of the formation of the He I 10830 and He II 304 spectral lines. Both lines show non-equilibrium features that are not recovered with statistical equilibrium models, and caution should therefore be exercised when such models are used as a basis in the interpretation of observations.</summary>

    <summary>  Liquid helium is crucial to conveniently vary magnetic field (H) and temperature (T) giving access to a large region of (H, T) space; in stark contrast with the effort currently required to explore a comparable region of (P, T) space. The centenary of the liquefaction of helium is an appropriate occasion to talk on the utilization of our facilities for studies across first order phase transitions. We observed some interesting effects in variety of systems traversing (H, T) space across the magnetic first order phase transitions. We focus here on a few recent intriguing discoveries in the half-doped manganites related to the coexistence of equilibrium phase, with a glass-like phase having both structural and magnetic long-range order.</summary>
