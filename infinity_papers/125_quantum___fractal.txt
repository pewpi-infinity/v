    <summary>The local theory of complex dimensions describes the oscillations in the geometry (spectra and dynamics) of fractal strings. Such geometric oscillations can be seen most clearly in the explicit volume formula for the tubular neighborhoods of a $p$-adic fractal string $\mathcal{L}_p$, expressed in terms of the underlying complex dimensions. The general fractal tube formula obtained in this paper is illustrated by several examples, including the nonarchimedean Cantor and Euler strings. Moreover, we show that the Minkowski dimension of a $p$-adic fractal string coincides with the abscissa of convergence of the geometric zeta function associated with the string, as well as with the asymptotic growth rate of the corresponding geometric counting function. The proof of this new result can be applied to both real and $p$-adic fractal strings and hence, yields a unifying explanation of a key result in the theory of complex dimensions for fractal strings, even in the archimedean (or real) case.</summary>

    <summary>Recently, a class of fractal surface codes (FSCs), has been constructed on fractal lattices with Hausdorff dimension $2+ε$, which admits a fault-tolerant non-Clifford CCZ gate. We investigate the performance of such FSCs as fault-tolerant quantum memories. We prove that there exist decoding strategies with non-zero thresholds for bit-flip and phase-flip errors in the FSCs with Hausdorff dimension $2+ε$. For the bit-flip errors, we adapt the sweep decoder, developed for string-like syndromes in the regular 3D surface code, to the FSCs by designing suitable modifications on the boundaries of the holes in the fractal lattice. Our adaptation of the sweep decoder for the FSCs maintains its self-correcting and single-shot nature. For the phase-flip errors, we employ the minimum-weight-perfect-matching (MWPM) decoder for the point-like syndromes. We report a sustainable fault-tolerant threshold ($\sim 1.7\%$) under phenomenological noise for the sweep decoder and the code capacity threshold (lower bounded by $2.95\%$) for the MWPM decoder for a particular FSC with Hausdorff dimension $D_H\approx2.966$. The latter can be mapped to a lower bound of the critical point of a confinement-Higgs transition on the fractal lattice, which is tunable via the Hausdorff dimension.</summary>

    <summary>  Departing from classical concepts of ergodic theory, formulated in terms of probability densities, measures describing the chaotic behavior and the loss of information in quantum open systems are proposed. As application we discuss the chaotic outcomes of continuous measurement processes in the EEQT framework. Simultaneous measurement of four noncommuting spin components is shown to lead to a chaotic jump on quantum spin sphere and to generate specific fractal images - nonlinear ifs (iterated function system). The model is purely theoretical at this stage, and experimental confirmation of the chaotic behavior of measuring instruments during simultaneous continuous measurement of several noncommuting quantum observables would constitute a quantitative verification of Event Enhanced Quantum Theory.</summary>

    <summary>Recent results in relativistic quantum information and quantum thermodynamics have independently shown that in the quantum regime, a system may fail to thermalise when subject to quantum-controlled application of the same, single thermalisation channel. For example, an accelerating system with fixed proper acceleration is known to thermalise to an acceleration-dependent temperature, known as the Unruh temperature. However, the same system in a superposition of spatially translated trajectories that share the same proper acceleration fails to thermalise. Here, we provide an explanation of these results using the framework of quantum field theory in relativistic noninertial reference frames. We show how a probe that accelerates in a superposition of spatial translations interacts with incommensurate sets of field modes. In special cases where the modes are orthogonal (for example, when the Rindler wedges are translated in a direction orthogonal to the plane of motion), thermalisation does indeed result, corroborating the here provided explanation. We then discuss how this description relates to an information-theoretic approach aimed at studying quantum aspects of temperature through quantum-controlled thermalisations. The present work draws a connection between research in quantum information, relativistic physics, and quantum thermodynamics, in particular showing that relativistic quantum effects can provide a natural realisation of quantum thermodynamical scenarios.</summary>

    <summary>Realizations of gauge theories in setups of quantum synthetic matter open up the possibility of probing salient exotic phenomena in condensed matter and high-energy physics, along with potential applications in quantum information and science technologies. In light of the impressive ongoing efforts to achieve such realizations, a fundamental question regarding quantum link model regularizations of lattice gauge theories is how faithfully they capture the quantum field theory limit of gauge theories. Recent work [Zache, Van Damme, Halimeh, Hauke, and Banerjee, at https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.106.L091502 has shown through analytic derivations, exact diagonalization, and infinite matrix product state calculations that the low-energy physics of $1+1$D $\mathrm{U}(1)$ quantum link models approaches the quantum field theory limit already at small link spin length $S$. Here, we show that the approach to this limit also lends itself to the far-from-equilibrium quench dynamics of lattice gauge theories, as demonstrated by our numerical simulations of the Loschmidt return rate and the chiral condensate in infinite matrix product states, which work directly in the thermodynamic limit. Similar to our findings in equilibrium that show a distinct behavior between half-integer and integer link spin lengths, we find that criticality emerging in the Loschmidt return rate is fundamentally different between half-integer and integer spin quantum link models in the regime of strong electric-field coupling. Our results further affirm that state-of-the-art finite-size ultracold-atom and NISQ-device implementations of quantum link lattice gauge theories have the real potential to simulate their quantum field theory limit even in the far-from-equilibrium regime.</summary>
