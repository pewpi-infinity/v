ABSTRACT:
This research paper explores the topic 'entropy & signal', synthesizing results from
high-tier scientific repositories including Semantic Scholar and arXiv.
The inquiry focuses on establishing cross-domain relationships and 
Infinity-OS-level technical interpretations.

SECTION 1 — Conceptual Framework
The subject 'entropy & signal' is examined using principles from quantum decision modeling,
oxide-layer microelectronics, hydrogen-doorway event physics, and generative
causality systems. The research highlights structural resonance patterns 
and feedback loops inherent to Infinity OS logic.

    <summary>Approximate entropy (ApEn) and sample entropy (SampEn) are widely used for temporal complexity analysis of real-world phenomena. However, their relationship with the Hurst exponent as a measure of self-similarity is not widely studied. Additionally, ApEn and SampEn are susceptible to signal amplitude changes. A common practice for addressing this issue is to correct their input signal amplitude by its standard deviation. In this study, we first show, using simulations, that ApEn and SampEn are related to the Hurst exponent in their tolerance r and embedding dimension m parameters. We then propose a modification to ApEn and SampEn called range entropy or RangeEn. We show that RangeEn is more robust to nonstationary signal changes, and it has a more linear relationship with the Hurst exponent, compared to ApEn and SampEn. RangeEn is bounded in the tolerance r-plane between 0 (maximum entropy) and 1 (minimum entropy) and it has no need for signal amplitude correction. Finally, we demonstrate the clinical usefulness of signal entropy measures for characterisation of epileptic EEG data as a real-world example.</summary>

    <summary>Information theory provides a spectrum of nonlinear methods capable of grasping an internal structure of a signal together with an insight into its complex nature. In this work, we discuss the usefulness of the selected entropy techniques for a description of the information carried by the surface electromyography signals during colorectal cancer treatment. The electrical activity of the external anal sphincter can serve as a potential source of knowledge of the actual state of the patient who underwent a common surgery for rectal cancer in the form of anterior or lower anterior resection. The calculation of Sample entropy parameters has been extended to multiple time scales in terms of the Multiscale Sample Entropy. The specific values of the entropy measures and their dependence on the time scales were analyzed with regard to the time elapsed since the operation, the type of surgical treatment and also the different depths of the rectum canal. The Mann Whithney U test and Anova Friedman statistics indicate the statistically significant differences among all of stages of treatment and for all consecutive depths of rectum area for the estimated Sample Entropy. The further analysis at the multiple time scales signify the substantial differences among compared stages of treatment in the group of patients who underwent the lower anterior resection.</summary>

    <summary>Time-vertex graph signal (TVGS) models describe time-varying data with irregular structures. The bandlimitedness in the joint time-vertex Fourier spectral domain reflects smoothness in both temporal and graph topology. In this paper, we study the critical sampling of three types of TVGS including continuous-time signals, infinite-length sequences, and finite-length sequences in the time domain for each vertex on the graph. For a jointly bandlimited TVGS, we prove a lower bound on sampling density or sampling ratio, which depends on the measure of the spectral support in the joint time-vertex Fourier spectral domain. We also provide a lower bound on the sampling density or sampling ratio of each vertex on sampling sets for perfect recovery. To demonstrate that critical sampling is achievable, we propose the sampling and reconstruction procedures for the different types of TVGS. Finally, we show how the proposed sampling schemes can be applied to numerical as well as real datasets.</summary>

    <summary>  The entropy for a black hole in a de Sitter space is approached within the framework of spacetime foam. A simple model, made by $N$ wormholes in a semiclassical approximation, is taken under examination to compute the entropy for such a case. An extension to the extreme case when the black hole and cosmological horizons are equal is discussed.</summary>

    <summary>Advances in machine learning technology have enabled real-time extraction of semantic information in signals which can revolutionize signal processing techniques and improve their performance significantly for the next generation of applications. With the objective of a concrete representation and efficient processing of the semantic information, we propose and demonstrate a formal graph-based semantic language and a goal filtering method that enables goal-oriented signal processing. The proposed semantic signal processing framework can easily be tailored for specific applications and goals in a diverse range of signal processing applications. To illustrate its wide range of applicability, we investigate several use cases and provide details on how the proposed goal-oriented semantic signal processing framework can be customized. We also investigate and propose techniques for communications where sensor data is semantically processed and semantic information is exchanged across a sensor network.</summary>
