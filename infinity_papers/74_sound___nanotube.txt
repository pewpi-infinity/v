    <summary>Energetic ion irradiation is an effective method for studying how single and multi-shelled carbon nanotubes break apart. The energy from ions is dissipated through both linear and nonlinear processes in the nanotubes, leading to defect formation. Fragmentation occurs via atomic collision cascades and thermal spikes, each described by different theoretical models. Experiments with Cs-irradiated nanotubes support these models, and an information-theoretic approach further explains the fragmentation mechanisms. Sputtered species yield probability distributions, which are analyzed using Shannon entropy and fractal dimension to assess spatial characteristics. Kullback-Leibler divergence helps identify the diversity of emission mechanisms. Together, thermal and information-theoretic models clarify and distinguish the roles of collision cascades and thermal spikes in nanotube fragmentation.</summary>

    <summary>Humans have a privileged, embodied way to explore the world of sounds, through vocal imitation. The Quantum Vocal Theory of Sounds (QVTS) starts from the assumption that any sound can be expressed and described as the evolution of a superposition of vocal states, i.e., phonation, turbulence, and supraglottal myoelastic vibrations. The postulates of quantum mechanics, with the notions of observable, measurement, and time evolution of state, provide a model that can be used for sound processing, in both directions of analysis and synthesis. QVTS can give a quantum-theoretic explanation to some auditory streaming phenomena, eventually leading to practical solutions of relevant sound-processing problems, or it can be creatively exploited to manipulate superpositions of sonic elements. Perhaps more importantly, QVTS may be a fertile ground to host a dialogue between physicists, computer scientists, musicians, and sound designers, possibly giving us unheard manifestations of human creativity.</summary>

    <summary>Audio-visual navigation task requires an agent to find a sound source in a realistic, unmapped 3D environment by utilizing egocentric audio-visual observations. Existing audio-visual navigation works assume a clean environment that solely contains the target sound, which, however, would not be suitable in most real-world applications due to the unexpected sound noise or intentional interference. In this work, we design an acoustically complex environment in which, besides the target sound, there exists a sound attacker playing a zero-sum game with the agent. More specifically, the attacker can move and change the volume and category of the sound to make the agent suffer from finding the sounding object while the agent tries to dodge the attack and navigate to the goal under the intervention. Under certain constraints to the attacker, we can improve the robustness of the agent towards unexpected sound attacks in audio-visual navigation. For better convergence, we develop a joint training mechanism by employing the property of a centralized critic with decentralized actors. Experiments on two real-world 3D scan datasets, Replica, and Matterport3D, verify the effectiveness and the robustness of the agent trained under our designed environment when transferred to the clean environment or the one containing sound attackers with random policy.

    <summary>Spectrograms are 2D representations of sound that look very different from the images found in our visual world. And natural images, when played as spectrograms, make unnatural sounds. In this paper, we show that it is possible to synthesize spectrograms that simultaneously look like natural images and sound like natural audio. We call these visual spectrograms images that sound. Our approach is simple and zero-shot, and it leverages pre-trained text-to-image and text-to-spectrogram diffusion models that operate in a shared latent space. During the reverse process, we denoise noisy latents with both the audio and image diffusion models in parallel, resulting in a sample that is likely under both models. Through quantitative evaluations and perceptual studies, we find that our method successfully generates spectrograms that align with a desired audio prompt while also taking the visual appearance of a desired image prompt.

    <title>Numerical simulation of sound propagation in and around ducts using thin boundary elements</title>
    <updated>2022-03-08T08:45:40Z</updated>

    <summary>Investigating the sound field in and around ducts is an important topic in acoustics, e.g. when simulating musical instruments or the human vocal tract. In this paper a method that is based on the boundary element method in 3D combined with a formulation for infinitely thin elements is presented. The boundary integral equations for these elements are presented, and numerical experiments are used to illustrate the behavior of the thin elements. Using the example of a closed benchmark duct, boundary element solutions for thin elements and surface elements are compared with the analytic solution, and the accuracy of the boundary element method as function of element size is investigated. As already shown for surface elements in the literature, an accumulation of the error along the duct can also be found for thin elements, but in contrast to surface elements this effect is not as big and a damping of the amplitude cannot be seen. In a second experiment, the impedance at the open end of a half open duct is compared with formulas for the radiation impedance of an unflanged tube, and a good agreement is shown. Finally, resonance frequencies of a tube open at both ends are calculated and compared with measured spectra. For sufficiently small element sizes frequencies for lower harmonics agree very well, for higher frequencies a difference of a few Hertz can be observed, which may be explained by the fact that the method does not consider dampening effects near the duct walls. The numerical experiments also suggest, that for duct simulations the usual six to eight elements per wavelength rule is not enough for accurate results.</summary>
