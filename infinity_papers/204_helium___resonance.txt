    <summary>  We describe a quasi-optical multifrequency ESR spectrometer operating in the 75-225 GHz range and optimized at 210 GHz for general use in condensed matter physics, chemistry and biology. The quasi-optical bridge detects the change of mm wave polarization at the ESR. A controllable reference arm maintains a mm wave bias at the detector. The attained sensitivity of 2x10^10 spin/G/(Hz)1/2, measured on a dilute Mn:MgO sample in a non-resonant probe head at 222.4 GHz and 300 K, is comparable to commercial high sensitive X band spectrometers. The spectrometer has a Fabry-Perot resonator based probe head to measure aqueous solutions, and a probe head to measure magnetic field angular dependence of single crystals. The spectrometer is robust and easy to use and may be operated by undergraduate students. Its performance is demonstrated by examples from various fields of condensed matter physics.</summary>

    <summary>Magnetic resonance imaging with hyperpolarized contrast agents can provide unprecedented \textit{in-vivo} measurements of metabolism, but yields images that are lower resolution than that achieved with proton anatomical imaging. In order to spatially localize the metabolic activity, the metabolic image must be interpolated to the size of the proton image. The most common methods for choosing the unknown values rely exclusively on values of the original un-interpolated image. In this work, we present an alternative method that uses the higher-resolution proton image to provide additional spatial structure. The interpolated image is the result of a convex optimization algorithm which is solved with the Fast Iterative Shrinkage Threshold Algorithm (FISTA). Results are shown with images of hyperpolarized pyruvate, lactate, and bicarbonate using data of the heart and brain from healthy human volunteers, a healthy porcine heart, and a human with prostate cancer.</summary>

    <title>Noncontrast free-breathing respiratory self-navigated coronary artery cardiovascular magnetic resonance angiography at 3 T using lipid insensitive binomial off-resonant excitation (LIBRE)</title>

    <summary>Robust and homogeneous lipid suppression is mandatory for coronary magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) since coronary arteries are commonly embedded in fat. However, effective large volume lipid suppression becomes challenging when performing radial whole-heart coronary MRA and the problem may even be exacerbated at increasing magnetic field strengths. Incomplete fat suppression also generates artifacts, and may affect advanced motion correction methods. The aim was to evaluate a recently reported lipid insensitive MRI method for self-navigated coronary MRA at 3T. Lipid insensitive binomial off resonant excitation (LIBRE) radiofrequency (RF) excitation pulses were included into a self-navigated 3D radial GRE coronary MRA sequence at 3T. LIBRE was compared against conventional fat saturation (FS) and binomial 1-180°-1 water excitation (WE). First, fat suppression of all techniques was numerically characterized using Matlab and experimentally validated in phantoms and in legs of human volunteers. Subsequently, free-breathing self-navigated coronary MRA was performed using the LIBRE pulse as well as FS and WE in ten volunteers. Results obtained in the simulations were confirmed by the experimental validations as LIBRE enabled near complete fat suppression for 3D radial imaging in vitro and in vivo. For self-navigated whole-heart coronary MRA at 3T, fat SNR was significantly attenuated using LIBRE compared with conventional FS. LIBRE increased the RCA vessel sharpness significantly (37 +/- 9% (LIBRE) vs. 29 +/- 8% (FS) and 30 +/- 8% (WE), both p&lt;0.05) and led to a significant increase in the measured RCA vessel length to (83 +/- 31 mm (LIBRE) vs. 56 +/- 12 mm (FS) and 59 +/- 27 (WE) p&lt;0.05). LIBRE enables robust large volume fat suppression and significantly improves coronary artery image quality at 3T compared to the use of conventional fat suppression and water excitation.</summary>

    <summary>  Liquid helium is crucial to conveniently vary magnetic field (H) and temperature (T) giving access to a large region of (H, T) space; in stark contrast with the effort currently required to explore a comparable region of (P, T) space. The centenary of the liquefaction of helium is an appropriate occasion to talk on the utilization of our facilities for studies across first order phase transitions. We observed some interesting effects in variety of systems traversing (H, T) space across the magnetic first order phase transitions. We focus here on a few recent intriguing discoveries in the half-doped manganites related to the coexistence of equilibrium phase, with a glass-like phase having both structural and magnetic long-range order.</summary>

    <summary>  A high-resolution study of the (e,e'p) reaction on Helium-4 was carried out at the Institut fuer Kernphysik in Mainz, Germany. The measurements were done in parallel kinematics (momentum transfer q=685 MeV/c, energy transfer omega=334 MeV) at different incident beam energies in order to enable the Rosenbluth separation of the longitudinal and transverse response functions.</summary>
