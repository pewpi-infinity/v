    <summary>We discuss the role of water bridging the DNA-enzyme interaction by resorting to recent results showing that London dispersion forces between delocalized electrons of base pairs of DNA are responsible for the formation of dipole modes that can be recognized by \textit{Taq} polymerase. We describe the dynamic origin of the high efficiency and precise targeting of \textit{Taq} activity in PCR. The spatiotemporal distribution of interaction couplings, frequencies, amplitudes, and phase modulations comprise a pattern of fields which constitutes the electromagnetic image of DNA in the surrounding water, which is what the polymerase enzyme actually recognizes in the DNA water environment. The experimental realization of PCR amplification, achieved through replacement of the DNA template by the treatment of pure water with electromagnetic signals recorded from viral and bacterial DNA solutions, is found consistent with the gauge theory paradigm of quantum fields.</summary>

    <summary>Time-vertex graph signal (TVGS) models describe time-varying data with irregular structures. The bandlimitedness in the joint time-vertex Fourier spectral domain reflects smoothness in both temporal and graph topology. In this paper, we study the critical sampling of three types of TVGS including continuous-time signals, infinite-length sequences, and finite-length sequences in the time domain for each vertex on the graph. For a jointly bandlimited TVGS, we prove a lower bound on sampling density or sampling ratio, which depends on the measure of the spectral support in the joint time-vertex Fourier spectral domain. We also provide a lower bound on the sampling density or sampling ratio of each vertex on sampling sets for perfect recovery. To demonstrate that critical sampling is achievable, we propose the sampling and reconstruction procedures for the different types of TVGS. Finally, we show how the proposed sampling schemes can be applied to numerical as well as real datasets.</summary>

    <summary>Water management is one of the most critical aspects of our society, together with population increase and climate change. Water scarcity requires a better characterization and monitoring of Water Distribution Networks (WDNs). This paper presents a novel framework for monitoring Water Distribution Networks (WDNs) by integrating physics-informed modeling of the nonlinear interactions between pressure and flow data with Topological Signal Processing (TSP) techniques. We represent pressure and flow data as signals defined over a second-order cell complex, enabling accurate estimation of water pressures and flows throughout the entire network from sparse sensor measurements. By formalizing hydraulic conservation laws through the TSP framework, we provide a comprehensive representation of nodal pressures and edge flows that incorporate higher-order interactions captured through the formalism of cell complexes. This provides a principled way to decompose the water flows in WDNs in three orthogonal signal components (irrotational, solenoidal and harmonic). The spectral representations of these components inherently reflect the conservation laws governing the water pressures and flows. Sparse representation in the spectral domain enable topology-based sampling and reconstruction of nodal pressures and water flows from sparse measurements. Our results demonstrate that employing cell complex-based signal representations enhances the accuracy of edge signal reconstruction, due to proper modeling of both conservative and non-conservative flows along the polygonal cells.</summary>

    <title>Graph Neural Networks for Pressure Estimation in Water Distribution Systems</title>

    <summary>Pressure and flow estimation in Water Distribution Networks (WDN) allows water management companies to optimize their control operations. For many years, mathematical simulation tools have been the most common approach to reconstructing an estimate of the WDN hydraulics. However, pure physics-based simulations involve several challenges, e.g. partially observable data, high uncertainty, and extensive manual configuration. Thus, data-driven approaches have gained traction to overcome such limitations. In this work, we combine physics-based modeling and Graph Neural Networks (GNN), a data-driven approach, to address the pressure estimation problem. First, we propose a new data generation method using a mathematical simulation but not considering temporal patterns and including some control parameters that remain untouched in previous works; this contributes to a more diverse training data. Second, our training strategy relies on random sensor placement making our GNN-based estimation model robust to unexpected sensor location changes. Third, a realistic evaluation protocol considers real temporal patterns and additionally injects the uncertainties intrinsic to real-world scenarios. Finally, a multi-graph pre-training strategy allows the model to be reused for pressure estimation in unseen target WDNs. Our GNN-based model estimates the pressure of a large-scale WDN in The Netherlands with a MAE of 1.94mH$_2$O and a MAPE of 7%, surpassing the performance of previous studies. Likewise, it outperformed previous approaches on other WDN benchmarks, showing a reduction of absolute error up to approximately 52% in the best cases.</summary>

    <summary>Advances in machine learning technology have enabled real-time extraction of semantic information in signals which can revolutionize signal processing techniques and improve their performance significantly for the next generation of applications. With the objective of a concrete representation and efficient processing of the semantic information, we propose and demonstrate a formal graph-based semantic language and a goal filtering method that enables goal-oriented signal processing. The proposed semantic signal processing framework can easily be tailored for specific applications and goals in a diverse range of signal processing applications. To illustrate its wide range of applicability, we investigate several use cases and provide details on how the proposed goal-oriented semantic signal processing framework can be customized. We also investigate and propose techniques for communications where sensor data is semantically processed and semantic information is exchanged across a sensor network.</summary>
