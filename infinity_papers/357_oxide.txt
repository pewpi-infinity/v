    <summary>Oxide materials exhibit several novel structural, magnetic, and electronic properties. Their stability under ambient conditions, easy synthesis, and high transition temperatures provide such systems with an ideal ground for realizing topological properties and real-life technological applications. However, experimental evidence of topological states in oxide materials is rare. In this study, we have synthesized single crystals of oxide double perovskite Sr2FeMoO6 and revealed its topological nature by investigating its structural, magnetic, and electronic properties. We observed that the system crystallized in the cubic space group Fm-3m, which is a half-metallic ferromagnet. Transport measurements show an anomalous Hall effect, and it is evident that the Hall contribution originates from the Berry curvature. Assuming a shift of the Fermi energy towards the conduction band, the contribution of the anomalous Hall effect is enhanced owing to the presence of a gaped nodal line. This study can be used to explore and realize the topological properties of bulk oxide systems.</summary>

    <summary>Several challenges in designing an operational Skyrmion racetrack memory are well-known. Among those challenges, a few contradictions can be identified if researchers were to rely only on metallic materials. Hence, expanding the exploration on Skyrmion Physics into oxide materials is essential to bridge the contradicting gap. In this topical review, we first briefly revise the theories and criteria involved in stabilizing and manipulating Skymions, followed by studying the behaviors of dipolar-stabilized magnetic bubbles. Next, we explore the properties of multiferroic Skyrmions with magnetoelectric coupling, which can only be stabilized in Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ thus far, as well as the rare bulk Néel-type Skyrmions in some polar materials. As an interlude section, we review the theory of Anomalous (AHE) and Topological Hall Effect (THE), before going through the recent progress of THE in oxide thin films. The debate about an alternative interpretation is also discussed. Finally, this review ends with future outlooks about the promising strategies of using interfacial charge-transfer and (111)-orientation of perovskites to benefit the field of Skyrmion research.</summary>

    <summary>Here we describe a computational study undertaken in an effort to elucidate the reaction mechanisms behind the experimentally observed oxidations and hydrations catalyzed by graphene oxide (GO). Using the oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde as a model reaction, density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that this reactivity stemmed from the transfer of hydrogen atoms from the organic molecule to the GO surface. In particular, neighbouring epoxide groups decorating GO's basal plane were ring-opened, resulting in the formation of diols, followed by dehydration. Consistent with the experimentally-observed dependence of this chemistry on molecular oxygen, our calculations revealed that the partially reduced catalyst was able to be recharged by molecular oxygen, allowing for catalyst turnover. Functional group-free carbon materials, such as graphite, were calculated to have substantially higher reaction barriers, indicating that the high chemical potential and rich functionality of GO are necessary for the observed reactivity.</summary>

    <title>2D surprises at the surface of 3D materials: confined electron systems in transition metal oxides</title>

    <summary>The scope of this article is to review the state-of-the-art in the field of confined electron systems generated at the bare surfaces of transition metal oxides (TMOs). This scientific field is a prime example of a domain where two-dimensional physics and photoemission-based spectroscopic techniques have together set up the development of the story. The discovery of a high-mobility two-dimensional electron system (2DES) at interfaces of transition metal oxides has attracted an immense scientific interest due to new opportunities opened in the emerging field of oxide electronics. The subsequent paradigm shift from interfaces to the bare surfaces of TMOs made the confined electron system accessible to surface-sensitive spectroscopic techniques and this new era is the focus of the present article. We describe how results by means of Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) establish the presence of confined electron carriers at the bare surface of SrTiO$_{3}$(100), which exhibit complex physics phenomena such as orbital ordering, electron-phonon interactions and spin splitting. The key element behind the 2DES generation is oxygen vacancies. Moreover, we review the experimental evidence on the generation of 2DESs on surfaces with different orientation, as well as on different TMO substrates. The electronic structure of the confined electron system responds to such changes, thereby providing external means for engineering its properties. Finally, we identify new directions for future research by introducing a device-friendly fabrication protocol for the generation of 2DESs on TMO surfaces.</summary>
